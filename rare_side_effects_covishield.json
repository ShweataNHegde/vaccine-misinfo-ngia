It dwindled from  Zenith to Nadir. <br><br>At the age of 44  years a young vibrant life journey was almost halted. <br><br> The journey of life was almost over but something else was destined and  again he got revived, but it is now debated that this struggle was uncalled for fighting for the life and family against the Vaccine he underwent. <br><br>There may be many more stories of millions of innocent who survived and more who perished after this Program. Heard that the court case is on in United Kingdom for the similar Vaccine. <br><br>Even after 3 years trying to come Back to Normalcy but a with Crippled Life.<br><br>Hope, Wish and Pray that justice will prevail and the preparators shall be booked for this situation. May God give strength to all the bereaved, as I am feeling sorry for the beautiful innocent lives which perished because of no fault of them. <br><br>- Paras SHARMA<br><br><br>PN : Paras Sharma is an author of his biography RISE, FALL AND RISE - BEING INVINCIBLE, available world wide on amazon and flip-kart. <br><br>The book is appreciated and selling in leaps and bounds world over.",

This leads to people suffering from myocardial infarction (heart attack) and brain stroke. Significant number of young and middle aged adults in the last 2-3 years have died of heart attack as a side effect of Covishield. The long term future risk of getting a heart attack for all those who have received Covishield vaccine, though low, is not zero. <br>The greedy pharma companies didn&#39;t put a label about this side effect in their Phase IV Clinical trials, and had to reveal it out in the court once litigation charges were pressed. Soon, this vaccine will be withdrawn from the market, and no one will talk about it.<br> Any drug that is introduced into the market requires good amount of research and clinical trials, which takes minimum of 10 years. Imagine getting a vaccine in 1 year; you would hardly know the efficacy and long term adverse effects. This is what happened with Covishield vaccine. <br><br>All those who are preparing for NEET UG, all the best. Work hard and don&#39;t spend your time watching YouTube videos that&#39;s not related to your preparation. You will always long to be a doctor and never become one. All those who will be doctors, will never spend their time here. <br>Being from aiims, people can have their own agenda. Don&#39;t get into it but use your own brain.",

I have tried everything to get the weight off and I just can&#39;t and the doctors have no idea why I&#39;m gaining weight for a couple other people say that they got Johnson and Johnson and they&#39;ve gained weight"

In the beginning when everybody was getting vaccinated, I refused to. I just knew it would be bad. I made the mistake of listening to those people who badgered me until I gave in and got vaccinated. If I would have only stuck to my belief, I wouldn&#39;t be in the situation I&#39;m in. I feel like and I look like I have aged 20 years in the last 2 years. My short-term memory is messed up because of some weird thing that happened to my cerebral spinal fluid. My hair is still falling out. I am still trying to learn to walk again. I can&#39;t walk without some sort of assistance.  Physical therapy every other day. Going to physical therapy so often has been able to introduce me to, too many people that got messed up just from the vaccinations.

It took until 6 years ago to make them do a shunt and end the pain. There are thousands and thousands like me with pressure in the brain, many different causes weight rarely one of them, for example trauma (such as being in a car crash) and more coming into the support groups having developed this after Covid and the vaccine and yet this is the first news article I have seen mentioning that this is happening to people.

Funny how everyone was out to hoard for themselves, that says alot about the mentality of some people in this country. This is what Fauci and others were grooming people towards, fear of a killer virus coming and a long history of promoting vaccines so that we would stick anything in our arms they say is safe and effective."

I was at home and didn\u2019t need to go out or get a vaccine. I watched as they repeated \u201cnew normal\u201d and coaxing people to get it for your family and community. Biden shouting just take it dummies? New generations were confused or thought it was cool to get it. It all can really happen like that and they haven\u2019t let loose since. <br><br>The silly war for Russia started after and that\u2019s when I looked into it again and refreshed my memory on all the research done since 13, thinking it was for fun finding out the US government\u2019s disclosed secrets. It has to be connected all over the world and these leaders are puppets with people like Elon musk to head to technological front. Likeable figures and scapegoats to hate on. They keep trump around to spread the big ego and narcissism. It clicks when you see things overdone or hounded around you as some \u201cnew normal.\u201d <br><br>It was all too noticeable how they were changing the world by coaxing us and we\u2019re in the middle of this Cold War 2.0 scam for new generations. JFK and 9/11 isn\u2019t compared to why they\u2019re doing all this. It really is spiritual warfare. They don\u2019t mention transcending or spirituality felt around, maybe growing up through school, on your free time. That\u2019s not just childhood, I tried to maintain intuitions and clam mind moments. <br><br>History before the 1700\u2019s is manipulated and there was a reincarnation or reset on earth. This dispersed everyone who survived and they moved to the new lands (wild west~ manifest destiny). The world was spiritual before and everyone built/shaped with their mind\u2019s.<br>The imperialism took away what was left of cultures deemed backwards practices. They\u2019re not human, illusive Government\u2019s sprouted and have been running this system we\u2019re born into like a prison. <br><br>New generation in the 50\u2019s and 60\u2019s realized this torturing system and war drafting, so they rebelled, but were coaxed back to work as if they were wrong. I think they had the right idea and we\u2019ve been going in circles since the late 60\u2019s. Nothing has matched or topped the togetherness and open mindedness of the short lived era. People can get coaxed easily and I think they\u2019ve just waited this long to do it more successfully. They don\u2019t just start bringing up aliens after denying it for decades since 1947.

It&#39;s meant for occasional pain. Not surprising that not using something as intended ends badly. Nothing is guaranteed and nothing is perfect, natural or less natural. Life is a game of risk management. Bodies are not identical enough to accurately predict what a specific individual&#39;s reaction to something will be. So you look at a bunch of people who did one thing and the same number of people that did the other and control for as many variables as possible and see which group has worse results. As it turns out, like with any other vaccine where there&#39;s less to react to that in a pathogen infection, getting the virus does more damage. <br><br>If you react to the virus like a bad cold, you won&#39;t react worse to the vaccine.

It simply is used to lessen the symptoms of a virus if you do catch it. It doesn\u2019t make someone more safe to be around, only helps that individuals chances of having a Severe reaction to the virus. Not lessens their chances of catching it. I would say if you are elderly, or have pre-existing conditions or autoimmune issues, then perhaps it has more benefits vs the risks. (If you have underlying lung issues your lungs might not be able to recover as well) However I don\u2019t think it has much benefit when you look at the risks for individuals who are young (I\u2019d say 50s and under)  and healthy. If you\u2019re older but have great health then again, it\u2019s risk vs reward. Especially kids I don\u2019t think they need to be getting them if they are healthy active kids. Natural immunity is always better than a man made solution, however some people can\u2019t risk that due to (as said before) already existing health conditions. <br>It should always be up to an individuals personal choice, however they should also always know the risks and benefits. Unfortunately many of the risks and usually health guidelines that are supposed to be followed were scrapped in order to release a vaccine quickly. (Ex: miscarriage rates were public knowledge until, particularly in 3rd trimester, the rates started increasing, and suddenly they removed public access.)  Which honestly makes me doubt motives behind such a vaccine."

                        "text": "Thats a problem with the News and media on the internet..while they suggest to people that when some people dont want to get a vaccine they become treated as outcasts. This particular &#39;alert&#39; of side effects . First  not everyone who contracts covid dies. Second, another example of the FACT that there are  other side effects that present themselves later down the road, whos to say that there arnt others.? I never got a flu shot when they were pushing tbose nor did I wish to get a covid shot. Have you noticed that theyve stopped talking about the flu shot recipients? Third, an example, being put in breathing tents as it turns out was not the proper way to treat covid, yet people were put in them.  The RVS lung problems that they have vaccines for has not been tied to covid vaccine, I think it is, because it wasnt there before covid vaccine. They didnt state how many people out of the 99 million have these new side effects nor did they say which pharma company&#39;s vaccine is responsible for these findings. Getting back to News and media play mind games with the public training people to belive if yoh dont go with the flow of vaccines a  person is less than a person and is a danger to be around, so buinesses, modes of travel, and  other public places comply by not doing business with the un-vaccinated, making all having to prove that they have been vaccinated. Our future, if this unconstitutional method of sifting out who is current with their health vaccines by having this information scanned on a card that will be presented to whomever before you board a plane, train,bus , shoppjng center, school, work   ,church, any public place you go or  might do  business with you will be required to have this health card. This was a hot topic at the World Economic Forum 2024 where it was stated in words &#39; this way it will be known who has and has not had their vaccines or not when the next wave of vaccines comes. &#39; It was as if they knew that there will be more serious health matters we will be guinea pigs for ahead."

                "text": "So when the polio vax was released it was done in conjunction with the AMA redefining polio.  They narrowed the definition of it to the extent that no one could diagnose any patient with polio.  This gave the impression that the vaccine cured polio because the number of polio diagnoses dropped precipitously.  People were still getting Gulianne Barr\u00e9 syndrome, Bell\u2019s palsy and all the other stuff previously associated with polio but it wasn\u2019t called polio.  This is like me saying I\u2019m going to cure traffic with a snap of my fingers\u2026wait\u2026first, let\u2019s redefine \u201ctraffic\u201d as \u201ccongestion of any horse drawn conveyance\u201d\u2026*snap*\u2026boom!  I just cured traffic.  Sure, you might be stuck in motor vehicular congestion but it\u2019s not traffic.  When the guy who creates a vax testifies before congress that his product causes more cases of polio than polio (Dr Salk sometime in the \u201860\u2019s?) you really need to question the motives behind the mandate.  It takes 5-10 years before a drug\u2019s safety can truly be determined.  When Pfizer rolled this beauty out in a year\u2026well\u2026you have to ask some questions.  My dad and stepmom but got vaxed and my dad died shortly thereafter from cardiac complications while my stepmom had a TIA, then got Covid, then got her booster, the had a stroke, got Covid again and died.  As far as I\u2019m concerned Pfizer took my parents from me and I hope that my stepmom isn\u2019t at the gates when they try to get in because she\u2019d allow them into heaven when they clearly deserve to be in Detroit.",

He&#39;s been through CT &amp; MRI scans &amp; Sonigrams of the legs, neck, back, kidneys, bladder, brain, lungs and heart with nothing showing up. Yet the issues are there and very prominent. Bear in mind, my father is 80 years old. But before the shots he was doing 3 miles every other day on the treadmill and 20 minutes on an elliptical bike. His doctors told him he would live to 100 if he kept up his routines. Then the shots and then the issues, which have been non-stop for 3 years. After Pfizer, with the help of the FDA, tried to hide their data for 75 years through the court system, I&#39;m convinced these poison clot creating bulls--t shots have something, if not everything, too with his issues.",

All coincidentally since covid vaccination . I had the vaccine to be socially compliant, travel etc. My joint pain post vaccine was ongoing and so didn&#39;t take boosters. An orwellian nightmare time. You were a social pariah and outcast otherwise,  like the civil war, it even divided family members! Times have changed and never will get better.",

Not a single biopsy taken from either of us to confirm their diagnosis. The treatment for PL? There isnt one. Apparently it &quot;goes away on it&#39;s own&quot;... Here I am, still suffering 15+ years later. can&#39;t even get covered for dupixent in BC, which is the only treatment we havent tried and has been successful in treating &quot;severe eczema&quot; (though i doubt it will do anything for us because I don&#39;t have &quot;eczema&quot;, it&#39;s PL!!)... If you or anyone you know has sudden onset of SEVERE dermatitis that started after their vaccination, please look into Pityriasis Lichenoides, or PLEVA.

Didn&#39;t feel the best the next day, could definitely tell that there was something weird in my body. A week and a half, 11 days later  I started to develop a problem with my left hand, progressively day by day getting worse, muscle loss, fiery hot pins and needles and joint pains, it got so bad I went to AE and they diagnosed me with carpal tunnel syndrome, a week later the exact same thing happened to my right hand, but my left wrist and forearm were starting to get it. Basically by the 21st of June virtually a month later things got so bad that I couldn&#39;t even lift  my arms up, it felt like I was being paralysed throughout both hands and arms. I got admitted to hospital, where they didn&#39;t have a clue what was happening to me, it took them two days and a few scans later. Then they drop this very rare auto immune disease diagnosis on me..dermatomyositis which is was that rare, that they didn&#39;t know much about it and there wasn&#39;t really a known cure for it, then they tell me I have a rare blood group. So the only thing that helped with the pain was steroids, quite a high dose, 3 and a bit years later and I&#39;m on half a milligram a day now, aswell as strong immune suppressant medication. Both of my hands and wrists have never been the same since. My right hip is collapsing and I now have a blood clot in the same leg, which you apparently become more prone to with this disease. I regret every day that I went and had it done, I&#39;ve never been the same since, I&#39;m 48 years old living in what feels like a 70 year olds body and medication dependent....I know something&#39;s not right here.......",

For most folks under 40 who are generally healthy, actually getting covid presents little risks and there are effective treatments, this risk is even lower in children.  The risk of significant side effects is much higher in boys and young men so measuring the risk/reward balance, there is very little reason to give the vaccine to children or teens unless they have a significant side issue such a Asmah and that reason gets even smaller in boys and young men.  Then look at the benefits side, the vaccine does provide enhanced immunity to covid in most recipients for a limited time period, about two months, and drops off very rapidly after that.  For many people, it might actually be better to actually get Covid that in most cases is less significant than a case of the flu, since the natural immunity that produces is more effective and longer lasting than the vaccine immunity.  Older folks and others with compromised immunity systems probably should take the vaccine and mayB stay out of Walmarts and Movie theatres until the situation passes.",

My doctor sais I had to have it as the government put a ban on people not being vaccinated couldn&#39;t be admitted to hospital,  so I got 1 dose done and was sick from that and when it was time for the second shot I rang up to cancel and the receptionist said well ur doc&#39;s not in for a while as he has covid virus...and I&#39;m thinking this is the same 1 he used on me and I said I&#39;m not rescheduling for it either I&#39;ll take my chances as I believe there&#39;s a lot we haven&#39;t been told about this vaccine and the government should be very weary as the truth always comes out in the end ...and look what&#39;s happening now. And with my daughter she&#39;s always asked was she vaccinated and she says yes and then they can never find anything wrong with her. I know my daughter and as close as we are she won&#39;t beg and wish for me to be there with her if it was nothing as a flight is several hours away and an airport 4 hours from me and she knows I suffer painful autoimmune diseases, so for her to beg me to be with her I know she&#39;s in a bad way yet the hospital can never sort it out it&#39;s a puzzle to them and I think yeah it&#39;s a covid 19 puzzle as she was never sick before being forced into having it or get ur stuff and leave the place now threat!! And I&#39;d like to know the person who says a vaccinated person will get thru covid better than an someone who wasn&#39;t vaccinated as everybody reacts differently to things! 4 people lived in a house and out of those 4 3 were vaccinated and 1 wasn&#39;t, guess who looked after the vaccinated people ...yep the person who wasn&#39;t vaccinated!
