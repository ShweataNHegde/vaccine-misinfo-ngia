I got the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine in May of 2021 as soon as they were available in my state I got it on May 4th when I could get an appointment and it was available May 1st I got it and I started gaining weight I couldn&#39;t understand why I was exercising and went to my doctor and they said everything was fine and might just be because of the shutdown I said to shut down is over the vaccines out I still have trouble keeping the weight off I have gained 805 lbs from getting that vaccine I haven&#39;t changed anything that I&#39;ve been eating I&#39;ve had my thyroid checked I&#39;ve had everything done test after test and that is the only thing then I have done differently is getting the vaccine and it was right around June 2021 that I noticed I needed to get a shirt that was a little bit bigger and it&#39;s just been going up from there. I have tried everything to get the weight off and I just can&#39;t and the doctors have no idea why I&#39;m gaining weight for a couple other people say that they got Johnson and Johnson and they&#39;ve gained weight"

If I could kick my own butt, I would kick me very hard. Getting vaccinated was the worst thing I&#39;ve ever done in my entire life. In the beginning when everybody was getting vaccinated, I refused to. I just knew it would be bad. I made the mistake of listening to those people who badgered me until I gave in and got vaccinated. If I would have only stuck to my belief, I wouldn&#39;t be in the situation I&#39;m in. I feel like and I look like I have aged 20 years in the last 2 years. My short-term memory is messed up because of some weird thing that happened to my cerebral spinal fluid. My hair is still falling out. I am still trying to learn to walk again. I can&#39;t walk without some sort of assistance.  Physical therapy every other day. Going to physical therapy so often has been able to introduce me to, too many people that got messed up just from the vaccinations. I want to hope that one day I will get better, but I don&#39;t think I will. Good luck and I hope you aren&#39;t suffering horribly."

Biden shouting just take it dummies? New generations were confused or thought it was cool to get it. It all can really happen like that and they haven\u2019t let loose since. <br><br>The silly war for Russia started after and that\u2019s when I looked into it again and refreshed my memory on all the research done since 13, thinking it was for fun finding out the US government\u2019s disclosed secrets. It has to be connected all over the world and these leaders are puppets with people like Elon musk to head to technological front. Likeable figures and scapegoats to hate on. They keep trump around to spread the big ego and narcissism. It clicks when you see things overdone or hounded around you as some \u201cnew normal.\u201d <br><br>It was all too noticeable how they were changing the world by coaxing us and we\u2019re in the middle of this Cold War 2.0 scam for new generations. JFK and 9/11 isn\u2019t compared to why they\u2019re doing all this. It really is spiritual warfare. They don\u2019t mention transcending or spirituality felt around, maybe growing up through school, on your free time. That\u2019s not just childhood, I tried to maintain intuitions and clam mind moments. <br><br>History before the 1700\u2019s is manipulated and there was a reincarnation or reset on earth. This dispersed everyone who survived and they moved to the new lands (wild west~ manifest destiny). The world was spiritual before and everyone built/shaped with their mind\u2019s.<br>The imperialism took away what was left of cultures deemed backwards practices. They\u2019re not human, illusive Government\u2019s sprouted and have been running this system we\u2019re born into like a prison. <br><br>New generation in the 50\u2019s and 60\u2019s realized this torturing system and war drafting, so they rebelled, but were coaxed back to work as if they were wrong. I think they had the right idea and we\u2019ve been going in circles since the late 60\u2019s. Nothing has matched or topped the togetherness and open mindedness of the short lived era. People can get coaxed easily and I think they\u2019ve just waited this long to do it more successfully. They don\u2019t just start bringing up aliens after denying it for decades since 1947.

Life is a game of risk management. Bodies are not identical enough to accurately predict what a specific individual&#39;s reaction to something will be. So you look at a bunch of people who did one thing and the same number of people that did the other and control for as many variables as possible and see which group has worse results.

It simply is used to lessen the symptoms of a virus if you do catch it. It doesn\u2019t make someone more safe to be around, only helps that individuals chances of having a Severe reaction to the virus. Not lessens their chances of catching it. I would say if you are elderly, or have pre-existing conditions or autoimmune issues, then perhaps it has more benefits vs the risks. (If you have underlying lung issues your lungs might not be able to recover as well) However I don\u2019t think it has much benefit when you look at the risks for individuals who are young (I\u2019d say 50s and under)  and healthy. If you\u2019re older but have great health then again, it\u2019s risk vs reward. Especially kids I don\u2019t think they need to be getting them if they are healthy active kids. Natural immunity is always better than a man made solution, however some people can\u2019t risk that due to (as said before) already existing health conditions. <br>It should always be up to an individuals personal choice, however they should also always know the risks and benefits. Unfortunately many of the risks and usually health guidelines that are supposed to be followed were scrapped in order to release a vaccine quickly. (Ex: miscarriage rates were public knowledge until, particularly in 3rd trimester, the rates started increasing, and suddenly they removed public access.)  Which honestly makes me doubt motives behind such a vaccine."

This particular &#39;alert&#39; of side effects . First  not everyone who contracts covid dies. Second, another example of the FACT that there are  other side effects that present themselves later down the road, whos to say that there arnt others.? I never got a flu shot when they were pushing tbose nor did I wish to get a covid shot. Have you noticed that theyve stopped talking about the flu shot recipients? Third, an example, being put in breathing tents as it turns out was not the proper way to treat covid, yet people were put in them.  The RVS lung problems that they have vaccines for has not been tied to covid vaccine, I think it is, because it wasnt there before covid vaccine. They didnt state how many people out of the 99 million have these new side effects nor did they say which pharma company&#39;s vaccine is responsible for these findings. Getting back to News and media play mind games with the public training people to belive if yoh dont go with the flow of vaccines a  person is less than a person and is a danger to be around, so buinesses, modes of travel, and  other public places comply by not doing business with the un-vaccinated, making all having to prove that they have been vaccinated. Our future, if this unconstitutional method of sifting out who is current with their health vaccines by having this information scanned on a card that will be presented to whomever before you board a plane, train,bus , shoppjng center, school, work   ,church, any public place you go or  might do  business with you will be required to have this health card. This was a hot topic at the World Economic Forum 2024 where it was stated in words &#39; this way it will be known who has and has not had their vaccines or not when the next wave of vaccines comes. &#39; It was as if they knew that there will be more serious health matters we will be guinea pigs for ahead."

For example, out of all the reported potential side effects any vaccine, only 1/2-2/3 are actually related.  With COVID that&#39;s expected to be lower because of people being convinced that the vaccine will cause harm.  But even if we assume all the reports are due to the vaccine, that still places the risk at approximately 1/60th the chance you&#39;ll be struck by a vehicle this year.  And any risks from the vaccine are far less than the risks associated with catching COVID while unvaccinated.",

They narrowed the definition of it to the extent that no one could diagnose any patient with polio.  This gave the impression that the vaccine cured polio because the number of polio diagnoses dropped precipitously.  People were still getting Gulianne Barr\u00e9 syndrome, Bell\u2019s palsy and all the other stuff previously associated with polio but it wasn\u2019t called polio.  This is like me saying I\u2019m going to cure traffic with a snap of my fingers\u2026wait\u2026first, let\u2019s redefine \u201ctraffic\u201d as \u201ccongestion of any horse drawn conveyance\u201d\u2026*snap*\u2026boom!  I just cured traffic.  Sure, you might be stuck in motor vehicular congestion but it\u2019s not traffic.  When the guy who creates a vax testifies before congress that his product causes more cases of polio than polio (Dr Salk sometime in the \u201860\u2019s?) you really need to question the motives behind the mandate.  It takes 5-10 years before a drug\u2019s safety can truly be determined.  When Pfizer rolled this beauty out in a year\u2026well\u2026you have to ask some questions.  My dad and stepmom but got vaxed and my dad died shortly thereafter from cardiac complications while my stepmom had a TIA, then got Covid, then got her booster, the had a stroke, got Covid again and died.  As far as I\u2019m concerned Pfizer took my parents from me and I hope that my stepmom isn\u2019t at the gates when they try to get in because she\u2019d allow them into heaven when they clearly deserve to be in Detroit.",

My cousin, also not quite 40, just had to have her mom taken off life support last Saturday.

Not a single biopsy taken from either of us to confirm their diagnosis. The treatment for PL? There isnt one. Apparently it &quot;goes away on it&#39;s own&quot;... Here I am, still suffering 15+ years later. can&#39;t even get covered for dupixent in BC, which is the only treatment we havent tried and has been successful in treating &quot;severe eczema&quot; (though i doubt it will do anything for us because I don&#39;t have &quot;eczema&quot;, it&#39;s PL!!)...

Didn&#39;t feel the best the next day, could definitely tell that there was something weird in my body. A week and a half, 11 days later  I started to develop a problem with my left hand, progressively day by day getting worse, muscle loss, fiery hot pins and needles and joint pains, it got so bad I went to AE and they diagnosed me with carpal tunnel syndrome, a week later the exact same thing happened to my right hand, but my left wrist and forearm were starting to get it. Basically by the 21st of June virtually a month later things got so bad that I couldn&#39;t even lift  my arms up, it felt like I was being paralysed throughout both hands and arms. I got admitted to hospital, where they didn&#39;t have a clue what was happening to me, it took them two days and a few scans later. Then they drop this very rare auto immune disease diagnosis on me..dermatomyositis which is was that rare, that they didn&#39;t know much about it and there wasn&#39;t really a known cure for it, then they tell me I have a rare blood group. So the only thing that helped with the pain was steroids, quite a high dose, 3 and a bit years later and I&#39;m on half a milligram a day now, aswell as strong immune suppressant medication. Both of my hands and wrists have never been the same since. My right hip is collapsing and I now have a blood clot in the same leg, which you apparently become more prone to with this disease. I regret every day that I went and had it done, I&#39;ve never been the same since, I&#39;m 48 years old living in what feels like a 70 year olds body and medication dependent....I know something&#39;s not right here.......",

For most folks under 40 who are generally healthy, actually getting covid presents little risks and there are effective treatments, this risk is even lower in children.  The risk of significant side effects is much higher in boys and young men so measuring the risk/reward balance, there is very little reason to give the vaccine to children or teens unless they have a significant side issue such a Asmah and that reason gets even smaller in boys and young men.  Then look at the benefits side, the vaccine does provide enhanced immunity to covid in most recipients for a limited time period, about two months, and drops off very rapidly after that.  For many people, it might actually be better to actually get Covid that in most cases is less significant than a case of the flu, since the natural immunity that produces is more effective and longer lasting than the vaccine immunity.  Older folks and others with compromised immunity systems probably should take the vaccine and mayB stay out of Walmarts and Movie theatres until the situation passes.",

My doctor sais I had to have it as the government put a ban on people not being vaccinated couldn&#39;t be admitted to hospital,  so I got 1 dose done and was sick from that and when it was time for the second shot I rang up to cancel and the receptionist said well ur doc&#39;s not in for a while as he has covid virus...and I&#39;m thinking this is the same 1 he used on me and I said I&#39;m not rescheduling for it either I&#39;ll take my chances as I believe there&#39;s a lot we haven&#39;t been told about this vaccine and the government should be very weary as the truth always comes out in the end ...and look what&#39;s happening now. And with my daughter she&#39;s always asked was she vaccinated and she says yes and then they can never find anything wrong with her. I know my daughter and as close as we are she won&#39;t beg and wish for me to be there with her if it was nothing as a flight is several hours away and an airport 4 hours from me and she knows I suffer painful autoimmune diseases, so for her to beg me to be with her I know she&#39;s in a bad way yet the hospital can never sort it out it&#39;s a puzzle to them and I think yeah it&#39;s a covid 19 puzzle as she was never sick before being forced into having it or get ur stuff and leave the place now threat!! And I&#39;d like to know the person who says a vaccinated person will get thru covid better than an someone who wasn&#39;t vaccinated as everybody reacts differently to things! 4 people lived in a house and out of those 4 3 were vaccinated and 1 wasn&#39;t, guess who looked after the vaccinated people ...yep the person who wasn&#39;t vaccinated!

We currently have the lowest infection rate in the US and we are full of old people who come to retire here and honestly it has felt extremely normal here. If you are going to blame someone, blame the fear mongers and the unethical doctors... everyone should have continued living a normal life since this virus started. In Florida we are, but in most places people are still in the dark. Btw, I&#39;m not vaccinated, don&#39;t wear a mask (like pretty much all Floridians around me), never had the virus, and have been going to work to the office since 2020. No one at work wears a mask, I know for sure my boss is not vaxxed and I don&#39;t care to ask people around me unless they want to share, but pretty much the other employees could care less for the pandemic either. Also, mom is not vaxxed (dad isn&#39;t but lives in another country), never gotten the virus either. A bunch of people in Florida don&#39;t care, don&#39;t want the vaccine, and don&#39;t wear masks. Also since 2020 masses are open, and in Latin Mass most people didn&#39;t ever wear a mask when it was still sort of &quot;recommended&quot; and everyone took communion directly on the tongue. Never heard a single case of the virus from any of those mass goers. Not to mention the tons of pollution wearing the mask has created, and the respiratory problems it potentially creates (which would actually make it worse if getting the virus)."

The total neurological cases represent 0.039% of almost all the UK and Scotland vaccinations. Most of the cases are the normal background level (ie the occurrence of these diseases in times before the pandemic). <br>It is true that in AZ cases there is a statistically significant increase above background for some , however, the greatest number of neurological cases (this is clearly stated in the research but not in the broadcast) is in people who are not vaccinated. For one of the diseases (myasthenic disorder) the research found that unvaccinated people were 60 times more likely to suffer neurological consequences than vaccinated people."

Just like on the pamphlets you get with medications, if even ONE person has a problem, known related or not, it has to be disclosed in &quot;possible side effects.&quot;<br>That means if one person happened to have a stroke while taking the trial medication, the pamphlet has to report stroke as a possible side effect. <br>Still, I only used that number because that was the number reported in this video.<br>We all know this vax is new. We all know it&#39;s the first mRNA vax on the market. We all know that any and all vaccines have risks depending on the person or circumstance. We all know reports by both doctors and nurses on the ground as well as scientists say it is keeping people out of the hospital, at least. We all know people can still carry and transmit the virus, vaccinated and unvaccinated alike. We all know masks will reduce the number of virus that can escape the mouth or nose of the person wearing it and reduce the number another person can inhale.<br>At this point, few people will change their minds about anything they happen to have decided on already.<br>So vaccinate or don&#39;t, it won&#39;t really make a difference to a vaccinated person. We should all wear the most tried and proven effective masks bc that really will make a difference to both vaxxed people and unvaxxed.<br>There should be no mandate unless it is a mask mandate.<br>And that&#39;s the end of that story to me.<br>Honestly, I only got both vaccines bc my company pays us $150 to get it and I need the money.<br>I honestly have not a care in the world about who gets it and who doesn&#39;t.  <br>The things I do care about are 1) if the government mandates a fairly ineffective, new vaccine, they ought not be able to avoid lawsuits of people who wind up injured by it, and 2) if a person gets hospital-worthy sick, they are unvaccinated, and there are limited  beds, they should be last to get a bed.<br>That&#39;s it.

But, one of the first things she said to me on the phone after only texting for months, was &quot;I got the booster! Yep, I sure did!&quot; It was so out of character for her. There was something off about her whole demeanor. I don&#39;t know wth is in these, and I don&#39;t know of every single symptom these jabs cause (although I do know of most of them), but I can say with 100% certainty that these are causing personality changes somehow. I can&#39;t fully put my finger on it, but something is definitely &quot;off&quot; about who they were before, and who they are now. It almost reminds me of the original movie, The Stepford Wives.

It might sound  weird to you that a doctor immediately says something cannot be vaccine related, but.. based on what mNRA is, we can say things about its potential functions. Imagine the following situation: cars were invented today, people are afraid of cars, a person walks into a scientists office and says: &quot;Mr. scientist.. I saw a great black spot in the sky! I am afraid it might be a car&quot; and the scientist would say without any further research into the specifics: &quot;that can not be a car&quot;. This person would have the same reaction as you do now. That person would say: &quot;how can this scientist be so incredibly blunt to not even research my claim and immediately state it is not related to what I think it is?&quot; This person would reflect very negatively on this situation despite the scientist being fully correct in not investigating any further. Do you see what I mean? mNRA is a known substance. It has its things it can do, it has certain things it is fully incapable to do. Trust the science!

A research paper can be analysed but in most cases not everything in it can be checked, not all source material has to be and can be available at all times in a research paper, that is where trust comes in. Credibility is an important factor for organisations in science, they do that by only publishing highly scrutinised research. So, even scientists have to trust eachother at least for a certain part of their research. Anyway this was not what my comment was about at all. I was talking to a non-scientist, and to a non-scientist, trust in science is crucial. Without trust in hundreds of scientists, a non scientist can do very few things in their daily lives."

If people are like me, we know it yet the research and the numbers are being shifted and changed. The bottom line is the narrative on MSM and our own governments are playing...of course others as well, are withholding as much truth as they can. I have seen proof in my own loved ones who sadly have gotten the shots. My mother, 2 and a booster. Shortly after her care home is in &quot;outbreak&quot; status. 3 employees have now recovered. 5 residents had it and 2 died, apparently everyone else is negative. What is strange to me is they are encouraging, yes! Encouraging then and now to come up and visit. Nothing to see here. I find this very confusing as the visiting rules not long ago were so very different &amp; there was no outbreak then! They also kept everyone there (the residents) gathering for all meals, activities etc. during this outbreak. Is it just me or is this very strange? It&#39;s almost as if they wanted it to spread. Now I don&#39;t know but it just hit me really wrong. Btw, they follow every recommendation handed down by the Ab govt. Any thoughts? Oh, I&#39;m subbing to you. I feel like you have valuable information &amp; if you ever do speak out to more people I can be there for it. You are a warrior. It isn&#39;t easy going against such pressures. We are all warriors. Sheep stay in the herd, not wanting to be noticed as it is safer for the sheep that way. Even if they don&#39;t really want to be with the sheep, they&#39;re too scared to do different. The ones standing outside of the herd are us, we are seen. We are not surrounded by other sheep as &quot;safety in numbers&quot;. We are indeed the warriors and we are fighting for everyone! Not just ourselves. What&#39;s interesting to me, is who will fall faster? How long before that huge group of sheep standing together begin showing signs of weakness. The heart problems, the GBS, the neurological problems, the clots...these are the things that the predators watch for. A few dizzy limps later that sheep is gone, under C19 of course &amp; not the cocktail. Perhaps an interesting way to see things, yet because of the battle we fight daily, it feels like we are the strong ones who are meant to be &quot;gone&quot; by now. Yet we stand around those sheep trying to inform and protect them on how to stay alive and why we are trying to desperately help them. Forever trying to look out  for ourselves and them. We see no divisions, just devious plans, misinformation, censorship, revoking of medications and alternatives that work. These plans are meant for us all. This is my opinion. How I see it. I also believe it may get a lot worse for all of us. The V&#39;d are no better than the un V&#39;d. We are not bad. There is no good vs evil among the citizens of this world who are not in the 1%. The 1% will be fine. They&#39;ll be perfectly fine through everything. Please. Let&#39;s work together and stop the madness. Sheep can still step away and be warriors of truth and transparency. Tell your stories. &quot;Be brave. Do something!&quot; - J O&#39;Keefe"

                        "text": "@@Frogbait935 I can sure think of one option Julie, at least for the peace of mind; that would be to build up our immune systems and overall health so well, that any virus would not want to be in our bodies....because it would be defeated and die. A virus doesn&#39;t want to kill anybody, but it doesn&#39;t want to die either. So you make your own body someplace a virus does not want to be! Okay? It&#39;s a good option to, because you can achieve that 99 percent recovery rate, all on your own....or: you can actually lower your odds of recovery by getting the jab, as the so-called fake, &#39;advertised&#39; rate of infection or recovery with the vaccine, is far lower than 99 percent. It&#39;s already being discovered, that the vaccines are way less effective than advertised. The unknown risks and the side effects, are the gamble being made. No long-term studies, no animal studies, just a chance that with all of the lies being told to us, that we might just believe this one to? That an RNA vaccine, that irreversibly alters and changes your immune system forever, &#39;might&#39; save us? If not...then maybe booster after booster?  It will come out, or already has started to; that your own &#39;natural immunity&#39; that we all got from our mothers, is far more superior against covid and the endless &#39;variants&#39; coming out. But that would ruin &quot;Porky&#39;s Big Surprise(s)&quot; I think. I am not an anti-vaxer, whatever that means. I work in healthcare, and have 2 valid medical reasons, and 2 or 3 personal reasons, to stick with the powerhouse immunity, that I have built up. I will stake my own life, on what I&#39;ve got, and not lower my odds by changing the amazing ability, that natural immunity has. I get a flu vaccine every year, I get MMR (mumps-measles-rubela) booster vaccines, that are (secretly?)  showing to be effective against covid as well. I got the shingles vaccine...the pneumonia vaccine, tetanus shot, all of them. But on this very risky experimental one? I will pass. No thank you. We will see who is still standing, quite healthy, alive and well, in two or three years from now. There is even an undisclosed rumor, among some scientists; that there&#39;s a chance, (with an &#39;altered&#39; immune system), that many of the covid-vaccinated,  could be dead by that time....but not by covid.  I&#39;m pretty sure that those big pharma companies will not guarantee that you won&#39;t be....will they?   If anyone thinks they have that answer; they are lying, because no one does. You think there&#39;s a reason for the &#39;no liability&#39;?....ya think? With over $80 billion \ud83d\udcb0 in cash \ud83d\udcb0 being taken in one year, they can&#39;t be responsible? Really? Not at all? Not for anything? At all? Ever? No matter what happens? That sure sounds like a one-way guarantee to me. With the billionaires having quadrupled their net worth in the last 12 months alone? Financial world history in sales has been achieved now! So....follow the \ud83d\udcb0 and bring on all those boosters that will be coming....just make people get a vaccine for every new &#39;variant&#39;, whether they like it or not, if they don&#39;t want it....then you make them get it. Right? (Because &#39;they&#39; must care about us so much). All of a sudden....they care so much? Even if people have a justified or certified risk, in getting jabbed with that garbage; Just force all the free people into taking &#39;the big-fat-chance&#39;. Why not? The money is good! It might still be 5 or 6 times more \ud83d\udcb0 they can make! World history is being made on the cash flow, so? Can&#39;t they afford to accept some liability now? They could if they &#39;wanted&#39; to. Or maybe some responsibility then, maybe that. We won&#39;t get honesty, we know that. That&#39;s just laughable by now. But I know for sure, there could be some &#39;concessions&#39; made. It&#39;s very fishy in Denmark, that there couldn&#39;t be that! Like....such as; no longer needing to wear masks, (except as determined by the individual?) At least that would be something. I&#39;m sure that by now; the boosters could be at no cost! Even for just one year? They have made 4X on their money....so what&#39;s the hitch there? No giving back from the historic Bonanza? Hmmm, what&#39;s really been going on here? Doesn&#39;t this seem to &#39;familiar&#39; by now.....to everyone? I think it should be. A little giving back, right about now, could restore something in us regular folks, you know? That&#39;s what is soooo fishy to me about all this. Yes....people die from things. That is a medical guarantee, that someday, everyone dies. You can get vaccinated in both arms and legs, then get killed on a freeway these days, or be killed while going shopping somewhere. I think that a real &#39;pandemic&#39; (used to be)....when 3 to 5 percent of a population has died. It&#39;s worth looking up, because at least here in the U.S. It may be from one, to one and a half percent, minus the tally on false death certificates, which there have been alot of. I was quite alarmed myself, back when all of this started last year. I was the sole caregiver, for an 88yr old man, who I did not want exposed to covid. So I get it. I really do. But he and I got curious, about how many people just &#39;normally&#39; die, each day, before covid-19 occupied each and every single moment, on main-stream (agenda?) news broadcasts, which we both got sick and tired of listening to all the time. Everywhere you went. 24-7 and constantly. Masks. Round stickers on the floor, showing you where you were allowed to place your feet. &#39;Social&#39; distancing was the language being used, rather than &#39;physical&#39; distancing? Why? Why not keep a safe, 6ft or 8ft physical distance with a mask on, and leave it at that? Humans cannot &#39;social&#39; distance.....we are &#39;social&#39; by nature. But I get it, everyone was terrified, wipeing down everything....wipeing and wipeing. No toilet paper in stores. From all the wipeing? I never uncovered that great mystery! Has anyone? What a fiasco we&#39;ve all had! Because a batt-virus, (animal to human) virus, was intentionally cross-contaminated in a research lab? So that it could transmit to humans? And....ok, the reason for doing that was?? So that the welfare of citizens could be? I don&#39;t know &#39;their&#39; reasons for cooking up the virus, so do they deserve to know my reasons?....for not wanting that type of vaccine in my vital, (and personal)  bloodstream. I own my body, and it belongs to me. I at least have &#39;soverignty&#39; over my bloodstream and my body. The government didn&#39;t give me my body, they didn&#39;t &#39;issue&#39; it to me, and they didn&#39;t make it either. I was &#39;privately&#39; owned, and born with: free-will and sovereignty. You can give away yours, and that&#39;s a choice that I choose to accept. That is your free-will and freedom. So do I have mine to? Because there is no &#39;price&#39; for mine, and I will not be pressured out of it. I will die with mine in tact. I was born free, and will die that way to. I have my choice, and you have yours to....&#39;even steven&#39;...fair enough? If not, then carry on....i will die someday, one way or another....but I will die with my free will I was born with. No one will take that away from me. Lots of luck ever tryin&#39; that, because it won&#39;t happen. It&#39;s not even possible, when your&#39;s is worth dying for. Kapish? Sorry for the length of this, but it sounded like you, (or others) might like to know you have options, and we do....there are actually alot of them. But it still might be good, for a responsible person, to make out a will, or a trust....pony-up on some life insurance, and maybe have a couple of songs picked out....for that day, that no one has ever escaped from? Except for: (the one who resurrected). Do you know Him? We can. We can know him, and love Him back. That&#39;s a sure thing! Guaranteed to. But the truth is: the truth, and all the world&#39;s doctors agree on the same three things: we were all born, we all live, and then we all will die someday. No exceptions. 100 percent of us. What they all don&#39;t agree on; is what happens after that. Right? But you or anyone else, can find out if they want to, (before getting there). It&#39;s a good time to get things in Order, and that&#39;s a real good place to start i think. Starting with: what is most important, and what really matters the most. Does that make sense?"

How dare you go around accusing someone of purposely instilling fear in those that have already chosen to receive a vaccine that could potentially come with serious side effects.  Wouldn&#39;t you want to KNOW if you began experiencing odd symptoms?  Wouldn&#39;t that be beneficial to your health if you could talk with your own doctor and pinpoint what&#39;s going on so you could receive faster diagnosis and treatment?  Instead of spending years battling something that is often dismissed because people and medical professionals fail to link symptoms to cause and most people are told they&#39;re crazy?  How about those who have already experienced death, disability, disease after getting vaccinated?  You want to silence them too?   How about the people that have valid reasons and unanswered concerns, that you want to badger into accepting something into their bodies that could destroy their lives.... because you feel morally superior?   I swear, step down off your self made throne for a second and take a look at your own behaviour.  No one that is anti mandate thinks that vaccine should not be available, studied, researched, worked on, and administered.... we just want it done with full disclosure of reported side effects, with publicly available resources for those it negatively affects, and with absolute choice in the matter.   You got it?  Good for you.  I hope your body responds appropriately and it does what it is intended to do.  Don&#39;t be a jerk to anyone else.  You are more likely to spread the virus because you are less likely to experience symptoms.  Allow people alternatives to vaccines.  I&#39;m open to daily testing and continued suggested protocols for prevention, but after discussions with my own doctor, I&#39;ll be sitting this round of circus pokes out, thanks."

The vaccines don&#39;t prevent the spreading, mutating or catching of the virus and it&#39;s many strains. What it does is MAYBE prevent serious illness and hospitalizations, if the individual doesn&#39;t have one of the MANY &quot;breakthrough&quot; cases. The benefit of the vaccine is to the one taking it and literally no one else. This is on the CDC website. The biggest issue is that the vaccines lack longevity studies. Every vaccine we have taken up to now has existed from the early to mid 1900&#39;s. We know what long term effects they cause. These C19 vaccines are still experimental, hence the CDC saying we won&#39;t know how they work until we take them, &quot;that&#39;s just how it is&quot;. Also, these vaccines are not that effective as the need for more and more booster shots arises. The truth is, we are in a global reset. Even if EVERYONE takes these jabs our world will NEVER go back to the way it was. This is our new normal. This virus is mutating at the rate of the common cold in which no cure exists as it has over 200 known strains. C19 will be the same, an endemic. It&#39;s time for everyone to embrace reality."

Knowing what I know about how incompetent the government is in determining medication safety, and realizing that this issue has become highly politicized, I don&#39;t feel that the true risk/benefit ratio disclosed to the public is accurate. In fact, European authorities are already telling people under 30 to avoid certain covid vaccines due to the risk of heart inflammation. How many millions of people got these vaccines before this became obvious? Clearly it was missed in the studies that led to the approval of the vaccines without cautions about age. Also, there is social pressure to get a vaccine now, and to portray them as safe to minimize public hesitation, and this is resulting in drs not reporting side effects, and just disregarding them as caused by something else, without further investigation, which again leads to an inaccurate understanding of the real risks."

Besides that, data drawn from the sample in the study isn\u2019t representative of the entire population of people who have been vaccinated globally. That sample is too small and not diverse enough, not to mention not randomized. That is unequivocally <b>not</b> how science works; you can\u2019t use data from one population to draw conclusions about a larger, more inclusive population. <br><br>B: Many of us aren\u2019t even anti-vaxxers.

The flu kills many people every year, and the flu shot was never pushed like this. Also, if you\u2019re looking for information about the number and rate of serious long term effects this vaccine has caused, it is suspiciously difficult to find.

Breakthrough infections are meaningless and the illness is mild in vaccinated individuals who would have gone into the icu. There is almost no point even counting these cases as they are less infectious and represent little threat to patient or health system. The vast majority in the ICUs with Covid19 are all unvaccinated. Vaccination was never aimed at elimination of the covid19 virus overnight. It was to reduce reproduction rate of the virus, prevent facilitation of new virus mutations for which ivermectin would be useless and safeguard the health systems.<br><br>Comments are being deleted by the so called sceptics like Jimmy Dore and Joe Rogan on their respective YouTube pages. Anyone who comments something contradictory to their claims has this weird YouTube error. I later found that to be deletion of comments. They are gaining more traffic from pushing vaccine skepticism (not plain anti vaccination info) around covid19 and the vaccines. Nobody is going to get any traffic on their YouTube channel by reporting the effectiveness of the vaccines. Think about it. Constant bashing of these vaccines has become popular. Once you start heading down that path, any correction to past mistakes will likely hamper your credibility. With respect to supports of the vaccines, nobody ever claimed there would be side effects. You just report anything and everything for transparency. By contrast, you and I can freely comment on the pro medicine YouTube pages without our comments being deleted. Try to comment something contradictory on a Jimmy dore video now. Go ahead. Your comment will be deleted by their hidden moderators. They cannot risk their alternative narrative being challenged."

I did talk to my freaking doctor.  This is the problem with some of you. You automatically assume if someone doesn\u2019t have the vaz, they are afraid or anti vaz.  There are more then one issue that people can\u2019t get this vaz and that\u2019s why we have to talk to our doctors. Now I did fail by not talking to my dr about the flu shot since I had it years ago w/no issues. Well, live and learn. Bodies change w/new disorders.  Had a really bad reaction. Won\u2019t be getting that ever again either and my dr wasn\u2019t happy with me. Now for other people. I\u2019m so sick of hearing other people telling others to take it for people like me.  I don\u2019t want anyone putting anything in their body they don\u2019t feel comfortable with, even for me.  You say they\u2019re afraid?  I don\u2019t see it that way. It can go the other way around too. Jumping to take something experimental would be done out of fear too!  People who don\u2019t take it know the consequences either way.  That\u2019s not fear.  They don\u2019t want to take something they can\u2019t get the full ingredients for and they want to see what happens after the experiment is over.  That\u2019s not fear. There are military men, police officers, firemen dropping out of their jobs because of this\u2026.those people are taught NO FEAR!  That\u2019s being smart. Do they know there\u2019s a possibility of dying. Of course.  But people are also dying even if they took it. So did you take it because you were afraid\u2026because if you don\u2019t there was a possibility you could die?  See.. I don\u2019t have a choice, but for me, I refuse to live in fear.  We only get one life.  Eventually, when it\u2019s our time, we will all die.  My family actually got their vaz.  It was THEIR CHOICE. We talked about it, but I told them the same, if they do it, it\u2019s for them alone.  It\u2019s experimental. I wont make those decisions for others. And everyone should be treating everyone alike.  The polio shot wasn\u2019t even perfected for several years, but even then people were given a choice."

There is a lot more where this came from, and these same exact people are now forcing mandates, literally the same ones who said it\u2019s either immoral, not constitutional, not their job, they wouldn\u2019t even try to do that, and mandates are not enforceable. <br><br>Just consider that. They quite literally lied. Like\u2026 didn\u2019t even try to cover it up, straight up lied. Just like they did about the border issues and almost every single other thing they said.<br><br>On top of that to add insult to injury, Johnson vaccine is at a whopping 13% effectiveness, and Moderna and Pfizer are around 30 - 50% effective for only 3 months, after which it\u2019s anyone\u2019s best guess\u2026 and it\u2019s decreasing daily because the dominant strain of Covid is now delta and it keeps changing\u2026 so literally, there is almost no point to getting vaccinated anymore because:<br><br>1. It doesn\u2019t stop you from spreading the virus to others. <br>2. It has highly questionable effectiveness to start with at this point, and after a couple months it\u2019s almost not effective at all, so the \u201cwon\u2019t get seriously sick\u201d argument goes out of the window. <br>3. Delta variant is now the dominant in U.S. by far, which the 3 vaccines don\u2019t help against. <br>4. Very little is known about side effects of vaccine beyond 2 weeks time after the shot, as studies used for approving vaccine for emergency use only looked at very short time scale.<br>5. Studies now coming out about spike protein entering nucleus of cells and causing issues for cell\u2019s ability to repair DNA, which in each cell is mutated close to 70,000 times per day and is fixed just as many\u2026 this spike specifically damages the DNA responsible for repair, and damaged DNA is the only reason why we age and get cancer. <br>6. Questionable mandates very late to the game when all of this is known. A speaker for the federal government was caught specifically saying that the mandates are \u201cabout compliance\u201d when asked \u201cwhat is the goal of these mandates?\u201d.<br>7. Nobody holds any liability for anything that happens to a person who consumes the vaccines as any liability is signed away by patient when getting vaccine. <br>8. Other unknown risks that are now arguably speaking equivalent to the COVID virus itself\u2026 it\u2019s like choosing between infecting yourself with the virus or infecting yourself with the virus in terms of risk\u2026 isn\u2019t it better to just walk away from both options if at all possible?<br>9. If we are mandated to willingly sign away liability on a legally binding document and thus forced to expose ourselves to bodily risk, shouldn\u2019t that be illegal or isn\u2019t that illegal?<br><br>Now to elaborate on the point I made about risk\u2026 I am sure it is still \u201csafer\u201d to take the vaccine than get sick with the virus, but since the effectiveness of these vaccines has decreased almost completely, the risk is barely justified whatsoever\u2026 you cannot get this vaccine and take your mask off anymore. You cannot and should not, just because you have a vaccine feel \u201csafe\u201d from Covid because studies clearly show you\u2019re not\u2026 <br><br>Now, I get to my point about mandates: <br><br>Why should we listen to the people who lied to our face about our health when our health is not in their interests and on the contrary their financial interests are for us to get sick and to make money off of our ailments, all while these people hold absolutely no liability whatsoever? <br><br>To me, that is enough to raise enough red flags \ud83d\udea9, stop, think for a moment, and smash that NOPE button, just like discovering a large hairy spider in the closet."

When no one in the control group died from covid you have to ask why? If it&#39;s so deadly society has to shut down temporarily then was the study way too small to draw scientific conclusions? How can you mandate something only tested on healthy people and why do healthy people need it if they are at virtually no risk of dying? When more people die in the experimental group then the control group from all causes of death, you have to ask, does it really save lives? 95% of covid deaths were from americans 50 and older. 94% of covid deaths had 2 or more underlying health conditions. Not everyone has the same risk factor of dying and 100 million or more have already been infected and have natural immunity. Most of them I assume would be essential workers who have been working the entire pandemic. You don&#39;t know what the lasting effects of covid are just like you don&#39;t know what all the lasting effects of the vaccine are besides the already listed side effects of neurological disorders and heart inflammation.

Among other drugs the pack contained  Ivermectin. Note these positive people were in early stages of infection. Early September, the Ivermectin was removed from the covid pack.

Yes, it has its costs. But it beats the hell out of living in a controlled and oppressive bubble, like a pathetic lab rat. That&#39;s not even living. Such existence is purely irrelevant."

I am not suggesting living in fear. That is never a good choice.  I am suggesting facing the reality of danger and take precautions to avoid death (your own and others&#39;) before you would otherwise have to leave. Loved usually care about that timing.<br><br>I was able to avoid reinfection when the Delta came through my village God. I had gotten vaccinated by then. I am very glad about that. Believe me...covid is something to avoid, even if you don&#39;t die. Long covid is a reality and no joke. I am saying that because I have it. I am at 10 months and really struggling manage daily tasks much less my business with this. I&#39;m lucky to have help. Many people don&#39;t. It&#39;s easy to proclaim how you don&#39;t care or believe it is as serious as vaccine side effects... before you experience it and have to live with it. Then, not so much. <br><br>I know there are side effects for some with some of the vaccines. My sister has a history of pericarditis. She is in Australia. We researched carefully and knew which vaccine was linked to pericarditis and myocarditis so we knew what to do. She demanded to avoid the risky one and got one safer for her. She had it with no adverse effect. It is necessary to do the research...but from bonafide sources. <br><br>I&#39;m glad you mention fear. There is a ton of disinformation now. This is what is causing the confusion and panic - fear. It is understandable given the situation to be cautious and concerned...for sure. But to me, it looks like those who are refusing the vaccine are the ones living in fear. My perspective.<br><br>Believing panic disinformation rather than calmly doing the correct research knowing how to discern and respect bonafide sources, is in fact living in fear. It is easier when in fear to just distrust all experts and jump on a bandwagon that tells you denial and avoidance is safer. It feels kind of good to believe it. Problem is, reality is just not so.<br><br>Anyway, I wish you luck. All the more as this progresses, there is no easy answer. We are all going to need it at this point. I will continue to enjoy life, not at all living in fear, but taking whatever logical measures to avoid an early death, my own and others&#39;. I don&#39;t fear death (not that I invite it) It&#39;s that life and loved ones are precious."

                        "text": "@@arisgreek8697 Thanks for asking. I can do that. <br>1...Neurological - memory, concentration (ex: on a bad day which is not uncommon, give me a list of 5 things to repeat, by the time I got to the third, I would not be able to recall the first one or the last two. No amount of effort would allow me to recall it. Everything has to be written down). The concentration required to fill out a form...forget it. Any glitch in some process of getting onto an online accountl for ex, like a password prob...forget it. I will not be able to sort it out. I used to create my own websites and was good at it. I would help my mother and sister sort out anything complicated by way of paperwork or online access or glitches requiring sustained concentration and trouble shooting.<br><br>1a....balance issues. My balance was perfect before covid. I never thought about it. Now I have to walk carefully and I hold on to things when I can. I often feel as if I might fall when I am walking and reach for the back of a chair, or a wall or tree instinctively.<br><br>2...Fatigue. I am not talking about &#39;I&#39;m a little tired&#39; as in normal aging. I mean in bed all day, weak and exhausted. Unable to sustain a conversation more then 30 minutes without having to stop and lay down..not sit down, lay down. The fatigue, when aggravated with forced exertion, gets worse and makes the brain fog worse. I have to pace myself carefully and I do that to maximize my functioning. Pretty much I sit up in bed and work from there slowly while running my small hotel on a computer and supervising my staff (thank Gd, already well trained).  I have staff doing anything that requires actual energy and exertion. I used to be out in everyone&#39;s hair making sure things were done well and helping with the work as times. I enjoyed that. I am a bit of a perfectionist, making sure things were as they should be in the hotel. . Now I mostly trust my staff and let them do it all, only occasionally coming out to check on things. <br><br>No amount of sleep or resting changes this fatigue. There is no restorative rest. For those who say, movement and exercise will restore energy, you don&#39;t get it. There is something called &#39;Exertion Fatigue&#39; with this. Exertion makes it far worse.Believe me, I have tried. At one point I set an alarm with the intention of walking around my garden 5 minutes every hour with the idea of rebuilding energy. I really had to rest after each 5 minutes. I was able to do this one day, two days (adding up to 20 minutes each day and I was hopeful. Then I was blasted for days following that, much worse than before.<br><br>3...pain...During the acute phase (about 3 months) the pain I had in my lungs and left kidney was so sharp I could at times not move at all in m y bed. I would cry forcing myself to move sufficiently to get up to go to the bathroom. I was prescribed strong anti-inflammatory. It has improved a lot since then. But I still am taking the same strong anti-inflammatory at ten months. I ran out twice. Within 24 hours, the pain in areas of my lungs and heart, across the back and in the left kidney resumed. Not as bad, but noticeable to slow me down, drain my energy more and make me miserable overall. There is also an overall body inflammation pain. It feels as if my skin were burning, stinging. While I am taking the anti-inflammatory, I can ignore it. If I stop that, I cannot ignore it. Pain, even the kind that is chronic and invisible to others, drains your life energy.Anyone who deals with chronic pain knows this.  It affects everything. I can manage it with the meds. But what kind of side effects will I be dealing with in long term use of these steroidal drugs? Possibly worse than most of the negative vaccine side effects that do occur, to be blunt and ironic.<br><br>4...difficulty with getting full breath upon any exertion, still varying blood oxygenation levels. If I go up the stairs to the second floor of my place (something I avoid doing), I have to stop talking and sit due to not being able to breath fully. I must sit and breath deeply to recover my breathing. Same is true at ties even without climbing stairs, but just engaging in too long animated conversation - talking and laughing especially - over 30 minutes  and I feel it. I have to leave the gathering to lay down and rest. There are also times when this gets worse for no reason. even when I am just in my sitting with my legs outstretched position, while on the computer quietly on my bed... my usual position. . There are even still times when I wake in the middle of the night and feel difficulty getting a full breath, have to sit up and forcibly get deep breaths. It&#39;s an awful feeling. I keep a blood oxymeter. it usually stays between 94 and 97 but still drops to 91 on occasion During the worse acute period it was down to 87 and 89. I had a bronchial infection and narrowly avoided hospitalization, with constant coughing and difficulty breathing. It is far better now at 10 months, but still not close to normal with any normal exertion. Before covid, I did the shopping myself, spending 4 hours, carrying things, loading, walking through busy markets all over the town center...with pleasure. Now, I don&#39;t have the confidence to walk up the street. My good fortune is that I am in a position to send an employee to do that shopping. I miss it though, It was fun.<br><br>5...eye irritation.... This is not a debilitating symptom but I mention it as it is a symptom and seems to correlate with other symptoms being worse. My eyes get very irritated, itchy and red and watery. Conjunctivitis. This was very pronounced during the acute phase. It comes and goes now, but is always greater when I feel worse, getting extremely and noticeably red and irritated. At it&#39;s worst, it causes guests in the hotel to believe I am sick with something contagious so I take care to stay isolated.<br><br> As an aside, I have always been an active person, a dancer and an athlete all my life. As another aside, I am not overweight, do not have diabetes or heart condition. Even with the natural slowing down in recent years (67 now) I worked out with weights, danced several days a week, went kayaking, walking, ocean swimming. I take care of myself. My nature is to be active and I have been in good condition all my life, which allowed me to survive cancer (Non-Hodgkins lymphoma stage 3, with a rigorous regime of chemo and radiation and a 30% statistical survival rate and taking a number of years of my life for treatment and recovery.)  I was seriously slowed down during cancer treatment for a time 30 yrs ago and I recovered well from that. I am no lightweight, I know how to be strong and persevere. If I say something is debilitating, it is. <br><br>I am - if very, very slowly - improving. I have to believe I will eventually recover.   It would be seriously disheartening if I didn&#39;t believe that. I keep up on the research and access long covid support groups. These groups are a huge support.  I intend to continue the pacing with the light exercise plan, only more gently. I do a little yoga (5 minutes now) and a little lifting of light weights...5-10 minutes every 2-3 days and the light walking I mentioned. I plan to work on carefully increasing these things as I am able. I meditate and eat very healthily. I miss walking and swimming in the ocean and kayaking the lagoon. All things I used to do.  I do have hope that this will eventually get better and I am committed to doing what is necessary to assist in my recovery. I am so much more lucky than the 14 people in my village who have died after contracting covid.<br><br> I am also committed to telling this reality to people who seem to believe covid is not real, or is lightweight, or is not as dangerous as the vaccine...etc. It is too hard to read that kind of thing as I live what I am living. Reality check is called for and I can contribute to that telling my actual experience. How this came to become a political/identity issue is a terrible misstep in our society, with real life terrible consequences amidst confusion, distrust and disinformation.  It is important to tell the reality first hand.<br><br>I am lucky that I have a situation with people helping me. I am semi retired and have a business I built which supports me and I have great help. I am able to rest. What do people do who must support themselves and a family at a job, take care of children etc?!  How can they manage?!  I cannot even imagine it. Add to that, that these symptoms are somewhat invisible and there is so much ignorance about it even among medical people at times. And then to have to hear people claim it isn&#39;t real, that it is a minor thing etc. is just too much.<br><br> If anyone is thinking that covid is a lightweight thing for anyone who gets it... I am here to tell you from my personal experience, you are so wrong. Apart from the deaths, there are untold numbers of people with long covid going into 4-18 months and beyond of what I am describing and worse - unable to work and live normally, support a family, do many of the things that bring joy. Imagine it...if it were you."

It means when something does not ordinarily occur. There is a certain albeit statistically tiny risk to taking the vaccine, however not taking the vaccine carries risks too. So, that makes for a great opportunity to compare the two approaches. There was a truly shocking viral video last week where a teenage girls smelling nerves were damaged, leading to all food smelling rotten. This was caused by covid. It is irrepairable damage. Quite scary! Taking the vaccine can also cause severe harm. So, we can say that both approaches carry potentially debillitating side-effects. Now we need to know which of the two is more likely to cause those severe side-effects. So let&#39;s say the vaccine is only 30% effective (in reality it is much more). Meaning the likelihood of getting covid is 30% lower. Even in this very conservative estimation, taking the vaccine is the much safer option. The one caveat is that long-term effects are unknown for the vaccine, although that can also be said about covid. All in all, I would conclude that taking the vaccine is the safer option."

Well, in most research papers there is also a short summary which probably is much easier to digest. So, I&#39;d point you to those probably if you want more high level but digestable proof."

Some of the side-effects from covid can be really scary.. I saw a huge, young bodybuilder that got covid.. I think the media call it &quot;lung-covid&quot;, that can barely breathe months after he wasn&#39;t sick anymore. Even if we say that vaccines are only 30% effective (in practice, they are much more effective than that) I think the risks of not taking the vaccine are still greater than not taking the vaccine. More broadly, literally every single thing you can do in life carries risk. It is just that the risk of getting side-effects of vaccines are measurable, which makes them more scary. Smoking is literally thousands times more dangerous. Eating fatty foods is a hundred times as risky etc. Many dangers lurk everywhere, always. Fact of life!"

The problem is that media and governments are suppressing reporting of side effects and making it seem far less of a problem than it actually is because they&#39;re afraid it will cause vaccine hesitancy. Doctors aren&#39;t allowed to say anything that may cause vaccine hesitancy, they can immediately lose their jobs for it. The problem is if something happens to 0.00001% of people it&#39;s considered rare and if it happens to 2% of people it&#39;s also considered rare, but the second case is a big concern. What they should be doing is not denying the truth and ignoring the problems of people suffering from side effects, but instead recognizing that it occurs, letting people know what risks they are truly taking, and holding companies responsible and having them research more and take steps to minimize these side effects instead of marketing the vaccine they initially developed with no changes whatsoever so they can maximize their profits"

So, we know for example that say 67 women have reported that they have experienced specific supposed side-effect X. The issue of use of the word &quot;rare&quot; seems very unscientific to me.. It might be the media that uses totally vague terms like those. At least in the Netherlands, we know the exact numbers and they are updated daily. The BIG problem though, as I alluded to earlier in this comment, is that those numbers include &quot;experiences&quot; &quot;supposed&quot; &quot;reported&quot;. Which could mean anything from a simple sigh of discomfort- to a doctor making a detailed report of a specific finding. Those two aren&#39;t equal. Also, reported side-effects include effects that are almost certainly not vaccine related, but because that lack of relation cannot yet be explained they remain on the list. There are hugely important details missing in simple statistics! Ok. Lastly, I would like to say that everytime I have looked up actual proven vaccine related side-effects, the overwhelming majority of cases shared two details: 1. They happen  to people that are very close to death anyway (many different causes like age/auto-immune diseases/other illnesses) and 2. they are very, very rare. Think in the direction of 100/million (If we do not count simple, small side-effects like a sore arm). In the Netherlands, we have 3 confirmed deaths caused by vaccines today. All elderly persons."

                        "text": "@@paul9156c That\u2019s a great question. It\u2019s actually a child\u2019s question though because science is quite complex and doesn\u2019t work in the black and white terms that your brain does. So there are a few factors at play. The first is that the vaccines were developed from the original virus sequence. Now two years into this ordeal the virus had mutated so there are multiple strains circulating making it not an exact match. It helps, but isn\u2019t perfect. It\u2019s very similar to how a flu vaccine works if you know anything about that. Every year they try to predict the strains that are circulating the most, the effectiveness of the shot is based on if their predictions are right. It\u2019s never fully effective. Secondly, it depends on how someone mounts an immune response to the vaccine. Every body is different depending on their age, the medical conditions they have and the medication they take. Certain factors, like age, medical conditions ( like cancer) and prescription drugs can cause someone to be what\u2019s called immunosuppressive meaning their immune system is suppressed in some way. When this happens, they don\u2019t mount enough of a response. The third factor is viral dose, meaning how much of the virus you are exposed to. If you are in line somewhere masked and another person is masked and has covid you might prevent enough of the viral particles from entering your respiratory passages. The ones that get though are then countered by your own immune system or if it advanced, then the vaccine kicks in. But eventually, there\u2019s a dose that becomes too great and an infection takes root. When you do become \u201cinfected\u201d, the antibodies from the shot gives you an edge in fighting it off, but you will test positive. Vaccinated people are afraid of unvaccinated people for several reasons 1.They are more likely to be careless and participate in behaviors that result in getting COVID. They also are likely to be unmasked, so if they do have covid, they are spreading it. 2. If you trace the cluster of an original infection it usually comes from someone unvaccinated. In a family, its the unvaccinated member that brings it home. They also are a problem because they get much sicker so they typically require friends and family to come help them and because these people are vaccianted, they often help. They get exposed to so much virus, that they become infected. If they had been vaxxed, it simply would not have been spread more. I have an unvaccinated friend that put her vaccianted father in the hospital this way. He was a high risk individual so in this case, the vaccine saved his life but you can see how she perpetuated the whole situation. If she had been vaxxed, she would not have been as sick and wouldn\u2019t have needed his help. 3. When you consider the mentality of unvaccinated people, its actually quite scary. They believe in grandiose conspiracy theories, they refuse to listen to healthcare professionals, protect themselves and others in public, and continue to promote a pandemic we have the tools to end. They are ok with their sneeze killing someone. It\u2019s incredibly selfish, it\u2019s dumb, and its dangerous. I personally don\u2019t want to be around anyone with those traits. It\u2019s like wanting to be on a road full of drunk drivers. So yea, we\u2019re scared of you all. You\u2019re a scary  bunch."

I too, had stashes of N95 masks purchased in December 2019. Unfortunately, your thinking is bias. Being healthy isn\u2019t going to do diddly squat for you, there is no rhyme or reason to this virus. I know many young, healthy \u201cunvaccinated\u201d people with very large hospital bills. Healthy and unvaccinated actually doesn\u2019t go in the same sentence anymore. Once you get covid unvaccinated, you aren\u2019t going to be healthy long term. The statement \u201d I have ivermectin in the cupboard just in case\u201d really proves that you will not be around in 5-10 years to see any data of anything. Make sure you take it early on, because the hospitals are not going to administer it to you when you show up begging for help. Your family isn\u2019t going to be able to sue them either when they refuse to treat you with it, since its absolutely worthless. Your family isn\u2019t going to be able to discharge you or sneak it to you in an ICU when you have a breathing tube down your throat either. Why don\u2019t you follow up on the idiots that think like you and see how they fare, it\u2019s never well. I\u2019m glad you lived without a flu to your ripe old age, I haven\u2019t had one either and I don\u2019t plan on taking a flu shot, as its actually a natural infection. But a nasty virus that escaped from a Chinese lab and has been altered to destroy the human body in a cruel game of Russian roulette- I\u2019ll take all the protection I can get. Enjoy your covid and your horse pills, and your ventilator. I\u2019ll leave the 5-10 year data at your grave."

I think what you fail to realize, is covid isn\u2019t a natural infection. It most like was created due to gain of function viral research and escaped from a lab. If you aren\u2019t familiar with this it\u2019s a legitimate working theory they have where scientists will often give existing viruses different mutations to see if they can create something more lethal. This virus most likely infected a worker and then got out that way so I think it\u2019s great you are healthy and all and do immune supplementing but I\u2019ve personally seen covid destroy two perfectly healthy friends. They survived but not without ICU stays. If you had an asymptomatic infection that\u2019s something you can check by having an antibody blood test. Also, I know people that have had COVID multiple times so a prior infection particularly if it was a different variant will not cover you now. People have gotten COVID once, had mild symptoms, gotten it again and nearly died. All I am saying is please be careful. Speak to a doctor that you trust and talk to people in your community that you trust that have been vaccinated about their experience. The problem with your thinking, is more people are going to get sick and more people are going to die and the ones that do often think exactly like you. Covid is like a fire, you can say its not out there or it wont burn your house down but it eventually will- not making it a big deal doesn\u2019t make it spare you. It is out there and it will come for you. For such a \u201cmonstrous person\u201d it\u2019s interesting I\u2019ve spent so much time trying to save your life. Please remember those who tried to save you if you do not heed these warnings."

The first person I knew that got covid in my circle went bar hopping the weekend this was circulating first in march 2020. Him and about five friends went to the same bars, were within 5 feet of each other the whole time and he was the only one that got sick. I\u2019ve heard of everyone getting it in one family, I\u2019ve known people where it was 2/3 got it or spouses were only 1 got it. A lot of it depends on viral dose. You could be giving someone a short car ride with the windows down and get it, you could sleep next to your spouse and not get it. It\u2019s the same thing with getting sick. You can get it and have it mild, you could have it moderate, you could get it and be hospitalized, you could get it and die. Maybe you will be lucky, never adjust your life and never get it at all. Although with omicron I\u2019m thinking that scenario is unlikely. As a Florida resident I can\u2019t even tell you how many people I know this week with covid. It\u2019s insane. We have trash on the lawn bc our garbage people are out sick. The pharmacies are riddled with sick people unmasked yelling they are COVID positive. There are hour long traffic lines because people ahead at a testing site are waiting 4-6 hours to be tested. All anyone can do is make the best decisions for them. I knew plenty of people who were unvaccinated and nearly died from this that were young and healthy. Also knew some that were obese and didn\u2019t have bad cases. That\u2019s the strange thing about this virus, you just never know."

There are requirements of either vaccination or frequent testing and some private business require vaccination which is their right in a free society. Please remember that we have always accepted such restrictions in our civilizations for the protection of others such as wearing seat belts, child car seats, drivers license requirements, restrictions about who can work at certain jobs depending on certification etc. This is how society works.<br><br> To answer your question, &#39;Why...when they are protected with vaccines etc&#39;. The vaccines are not 100% effective against infection as you probably have seen in the info. They vary from 68-95%  in a changing situation. here are people who cannot be vaccinated due to compromised immune issues such as transplant patients. The vaccine resistance has put the entire population at more risk. <br><br>This is a fact The entire issue is possibly now out of date due to new variants. Slow vaccine rollout, mask resistance, together with government corruption in early failings to deal with this pandemic in every way,  have already brought us to another level of risk.<br><br>Because of the slow rollout and so many refusing to wear masks or to be vaccinated, many variants have been able to form. We now face a worse situation with a new strain more contagious than Delta more deadly and also resistant to the vaccines. This has happened because we could not get cooperation via masking and vaccinations soon enough to stop the spread of the early versions. <br><br>We have done this to ourselves through misplaced panic, lack of understanding of science and intentional spread of misinformation.<br><br>Still people will not read the science so they can understand that. We are in a grave situation now, worse than before, due to panic, ignorance and corruption on high levels of government. <br><br>If this new variant spread takes off (likely as so many refuse precautions), temporarily not buying clothes in the shop of your choice will be least of your worries.

Since you didn&#39;t mention in this comment what exactly you didn&#39;t understand, it&#39;s hard to clarify. Guessing, I can only say that having gotten covid before getting vaccinated, my experience can be an example of how bad it can be in an ongoing way with long covid specifically when unvaccinated. This can be useful information for those who are still not vaccinated. The vaccines are known to lessen the intensity of the illness. Of course this is relevant and can make a serious difference in one&#39;s quality of life.<br><br>About getting covid from someone in the vaccination center, obviously a person who is getting vaccinated (and has no symptoms) can already have covid and therefore can spread it there. This is why precautions are taken. Also, it takes some time for the vaccines to incite the body to create more antibodies...several days, I believe. So of course it is possible to get it at a vaccination center.<br><br>As we have been told from the start, with actual percentages, no vaccine prevents 100%. What they do is greatly reduce infection and intensity. This of course matters. That reduction is life or death for many people and ability or inability for many people.

This is a deadly virus that got out of a lab accidentally where they were doing &quot;gain of function&quot; research. That makes them play with viruses to make them more deadly than they are- hence, covid. It doesn&#39;t matter how healthy you are- there are outliers with the virus, like the broadway actor Nick Cordero who died, or David Lat ( I went to school with a friend of his, who was a young healthy lawyer put on a ventilator from covid at the start of the pandemic, he was on the news) or my friends husband, or my doctors who should have all been fine, and they were NOT. I&#39;m a chronic illness patient due to genetic reasons but and the cardiology practices I go to have two year wait lists for new patients now because of what covid has left these people with long term. Honestly, if you are THAT anti-vaxx or can&#39;t get the vaccine for a medical reason, you need to mask with a good N95 until anti viral pills get approved and do regular testing so you can catch it early. Your best survival bet is to get monoclonal antibodies right away if you test positive if you live in a state that allows that. My state you need to be hospitalized or high risk to receive them. The monoclonal antibodies are what saved my friends spouse when he was hospitalized but unfortunately he had to spend a good week and a half at home until his lips turned blue and they admitted him. He will also never be the same health wise after this ordeal. The monoclonal antibodies use the same technology as the vaccine, they are experimental and not FDA approved and not nearly as life saving statistically wise as a vaccine. You&#39;ll end up for a huge bill if you end up hospitalized from this. This individual ended up surviving but then ran to get vaccinated after he was released. You can&#39;t be cavalier and think your vitamin D and horse pills are going to save you. This virus was engineered (accidentally) to kill as many as it has. There is nothing natural about the infection. It did NOT come from nature. So if you have a problem with the vaccine, you should really have a problem with a manufactured virus. The vaccines are going to neutralize the horrible weapon the virus is. Please speak to a medical professional in your area and other people who have been vaccinated. Speak to people who have been hospitalized for covid. It helps paint the larger picture."

In Russia they do long term fasting for cancer victims so their chemotherapy isn\u2019t nearly as tough on them. I think Amazon Prime had that documentary if you want to check it out. Congratulations on your weight loss. If you haven\u2019t tried I.F., give it a shot. Just start slowly so you aren\u2019t miserable. Once you can do 48 fasts, or close to that, add in a homemade electrolyte solution. Zero calories so it doesn\u2019t take you out of the fasting state."

Only a small percentage will actually take the time to learn about food and health. My sister is a RN and she knows they only get, I think it was something like 4(?) hours of training on nutrition. One time I went to the doctor because I was just getting back into exercising and I barely did anything and wanted to vomit. I was just out of shape. But his advice was to eat those gel packs by Gatorade for the carbs. I looked at him and said, can\u2019t I just eat a banana or oatmeal to get that. He said, umm, I guess you could. I\u2019m thinking why would I want to eat \u201cgel\u201d that has so many unnatural chemicals in it when I could eat something that\u2019s actual food? Just dumb. I don\u2019t currently eat that stuff, but at the time it became part of my lifestyle. I got into shape beyond what I have ever been. Then I hit a low and lost it all. Trying to get back into it.

I sort of know the answer, and it isn&#39;t academic research, trawling through peer reviewed studies and research papers, actually studying Microbiology from the bottom up, or attending or watching actual lectures. It&#39;s going online and listening to snake oil salesmen telling you what your paranoid delusions want to hear. COVID-19 is the disease, not the virus- that&#39;s SARS CoV-2.  Notice the 2? Thats because SARS CoV- was known as SARS at the time when it broke out in 2003. It was very similar to SARS CoV-2- hence the 2. Coronaviruses are a problem, and since 2003 Scientists globally have been working on ways to fight future epidemics- &quot;gain of function&quot; is one tool to help this. But what we do know is that it&#39;s a zoonotic virus, started in bats (as others have before) and passed through another animal before transmitting to humans. This has happened for thousands of years with viruses and will continue until we find a way to deal with them. It was not man made and released as part of a plan.  A virus is a terrible weapon to be used because of its ability to mutate, you are confusing viruses with bacteria- which have often been weaponised in the past. Learn to differentiate because saying that it was released intentionally can only come from those totally ignorant on the subject.<br> As for your comment about not receiving truth from the media, well let me tell you something, you are being lied to so much more by the sites you are reading and watching online than any major news media...so just stop watching that dumb stuff because you are so misinformed it&#39;s laughable. On science try reading science journals, on statistics learn how to do correct statistical analysis 1st, then learn how to interpret the figures from a medical standpoint....instead of believing your scary nonsense.<br>Lastly, no, the risk should not be up to the individual- especially as the antivaxxers (pro-deathers) are just receptacles for disinformation and are basically too stupid to understand Virology anyway, because by not vaccinating they put others at risk and make the epidemic continue longer so harm millions of others. You want to live in a society then you have to conform for the greater good- that&#39;s why there are speed limits and  laws in general. You put others at risk then you should pay the consequences Anti vaxxers have no right to put others in danger, no right at all. The higher the % of the population vaccinated the safer everybody is so if some, because of their utter ignorance and gullibility, choose not to then they are wilfully hurting society so they must be barred from restaurants, bars, all public places with crowds etc. Otherwise its like welcoming a murderer into your midst. Next up, all antivaxxers should sign a form denying medical science and stating that they understand seeing a Doctor or going to hospital is now not an option for them at anytime in the future. Lastly, they must take responsibility for their actions- 1st degree murder if they infect someone who dies. Also a &quot;stand your ground law&quot; that allows anyone to defend their private property or business from these Antivaxxers (pro-deathers) with deadly force- you can shoot someone who is a threat to your family, friends and colleagues with reasonable grounds- someone ignorant who may be carrying a deadly disease is a threat so people have a right to defend themselves against these brainwashed zombies."

No. You want to live in society then you have to do things for the greater good otherwise we have anarchy. There are speed limits for a reason, murder is not acceptable, kids have to go to school etc. Vaccines are not dangerous- and prevent serious illness and deaths by at least a factor of 10.<br>Just because some people are really thick and think vaccines are dangerous- because they are also gullible and believe any old paranoid nonsense (because they don&#39;t actually understand Microbiology) does not mean they can abscond their responsibility to others. Those refusing to vaccinate are a danger to others in society as they are, basically, disease lovers. They can make their uneducated &quot;choice&quot; but they have no rights whatsoever to expose others to risk so should be banned from all places where large groups are and from anywhere inside with lots of people. The unvaccinated can do more damage to others than a terrorist with a suicide vest and should be treated accordingly. At the very least these antivaxxers should sign a declaration that they forgo any access to healthcare if they get infected (why should healthcare workers be put at risk because of antivaxxers stupidity) and that they understand that if they infect someone who later dies then they face charges for wilful murder- stupidity is no defense."

I&#39;ve had so many wards in their 90&#39;s, some close to 100, who still had a very good life. This woman, for example, is 97 and she also refused the vaccine. She showers, dresses and cooks by herself. Every morning she goes out walking and although she can&#39;t hear well, she&#39;s still super fit in the mind. She liked playing cards everyday with her friends but she&#39;s been now quite sad for months because her best friend died directly after the second shot and the other friends can&#39;t do anything anymore, they can&#39;t play, they can&#39;t have a coherent conversation, they don&#39;t have a drive to do anything anymore. She says she feels now like living among zombies because the majority are vaccinated. I&#39;m glad that Caritas is not obliging any of the staff members nor any of the residents in their homes to get vaccinated. Like I said, the boss and many care givers think this whole plan is a genocide."

Most of the doctors don&#39;t find any connection between the vaccine and the side effects and the worst part is that sadly most of the relatives don&#39;t care enough. The  majority believe the whole narrative that the vaccine is the best you get and that it is safe.

Remember it&#39;s the fat soluble version of B1 called Benfotiamine. You can purchase this from Amazon. Also please look into the health of your gut since 70 - 80% of your immune system is located in your gut. And your gut is connected to your brain which could then be expressing these neurological symptoms. Try to create an anti inflammatory environment for your body through healthy eating and supplementation. I wish you good health."

However, I am in pretty good shape and very active, and I work outside everyday, in the fresh air and sunshine (one thing viruses hate is fresh air and sunshine!)...unlike most of the people that have died from &quot;covid&quot; that already had unhealthy lifestyles or existing comorbidities. <br><br>It was bad, I will agree. I had to sleep at night for almost a full week sitting up because I couldn&#39;t breathe lying down. At that time, this wasn&#39;t even a thing. I did NOT go to a Doctor because I just thought I caught a real bad case of the yearly flu......that I get EVERY year. It took me 4 solid weeks to kick it, unlike the 2 weeks it takes me to kick the regular flu. So yeah, it was bad, but it is survivable for those that are somewhat healthy and have no comorbidities. Delta didn&#39;t even affect me since I already had the antibodies to the parent strain."

There\u2019s a lot more they could add to that spending bill that would be so helpful to peoples immune systems and just making people stronger and more resilient in general.

If not treating it right away right when the person first starts experiencing pain, usually starting from their feet, the person can die within a few days. The person can develop pneumonia quickly because of weak immune system. She still suffers tingling and numbness on both of her feet to this day, but her soreness are not as present before. Some people are lucky and all of the tingling, numbness, and soreness disappears for them after being hospitalized. Afterward, she had to go to physical therapy too because after being in the ICU for awhile, your body can no longer move. My mom actually struggle for about 6-7 months in total just get back to where she is today. But bare in mind that GBS is no joke.

It\u2019s absurd how they are denying any reactions and everyone is seeing in black and white. I\u2019m tired of people on both sides. Vaccines can cause severe adverse events and Covid is dangerous. We need to still take it seriously, but not force people to risk their body and health with a vaccine. It doesn\u2019t make sense. It\u2019s like you might die from this vaccine, but you have a slightly higher chance of dying from Covid. What about neither???? The risk is too high on both sides.",

People who are metabolically healthy have lower viral loads, that is the reason why as a civilization, If we really want to beat this virus, need to start strengthening our immune system by exercise and eating foods that do not contain hyper palatable sugars. Getting a good nights sleep is also very beneficial for the immune system and every system of the body. Disease severity is decreased by exercise. It is recommended to exercise at least 150 minutes per week or more if you feel up to the challenge.",

Additionally, there are 10-30 cases of hemorragia stroke per 100,000 so about 100-300 per million. So we expect 1,000 - 3,000 per 10 million so we could say it reduces the risk of hemorrhagic stroke since they had less than a 100. It\u2019s all framing. They may have just been diagnosed because of the monitoring for vaccine effects. Neither of these are significant enough statically to be directly cause or correlated to the vaccine. My heart goes out to those who got diagnosed. A lot of these other side effects are the same as the potential rare side effect of the flu such as myocarditis, Decreased Blood Platelets, Inflammation Of The Spinal Cord or blood vessels, Encephalopathy, Guillain-Barre Syndrome, Sudden Blindness And Pain Upon Moving the eye, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, Trouble Breathing or anaphylaxis, Angioedema, A Hypersensitivity Reaction To A Drug, A Serum Sickness Reaction, Bell&#39;s Palsy Paralysis Of One Side Of The Face, Cellulitis, A Disorder Of The Brachial Plexus, A Bundle Of Nerves In The Shoulder, etc. All vaccines have crazy rare side effects that they have to report if they had even one case which may not have been related to the vaccine aka they were going to stroke with or without the vaccine.",

Ever since she has been ill for months and was quite fit and well for her age beforehand - sadly she died this week after being admitted to hospital for the fourth time in 6 months - her death was caused by liver cancer that had already spread to her lymph nodes, her grandson told me that she was warned that this could happen when she received treatment for the blood clot. She decided she didn\u2019t want any more treatments and passed away a few days after her cancer diagnosis. <br><br>I\u2019m double vaccinated but wish I hadn\u2019t been, although I\u2019m fine  -  I\u2019m not taking another chance on any experimental vaccines administered by non professional people.

That would be ok, if the spike protein was inert.  But, it\u2019s not.  <br><br>Research now shows the spike protein is now associated with several major disease processes by creating autoimmune and blood pathology within your system.  And, these side effects become exponentially more severe with EVERY BOOSTER.<br><br>The scary part is; it\u2019s permenant.  Your cells continue to release the spike protein for life.<br><br>This is not the case with natural immunity from a typical COVID 19 infection.  Spike proteins are released but only for a limited time.<br><br>Natural immunity also averages 25-30 antibody markers.  Not 1, as with the vaccine.  Natural immunity is so far superior to a vaccine; it\u2019s silly.<br><br>Israeli medical research and published papers have found the vaccine is only effective for 90 days.  But, spike protein release continues.<br><br>This is why they say you need continuous \u201cboosters.\u201d<br><br>Why do some have zero effects and others severe effects?  <br><br>That\u2019s because Pfizer varied the dosages and included placebo vaccines at percentages of 20-28%.  <br><br>This is because Pfizer didn\u2019t have the opportunity to research the vaccine; so they utilized the public as a test demographic.<br><br>Those of your who want to stay in your own fantasy bubble and feed your confirmation bias; rationalizing what I posted here isn\u2019t true.   <br><br>We had effective treatments for COVID complications.  We should have focused on that.  <br><br>Not developing a mRNA vaccine without testing and safety protocols.  However, the vaccine was worth billions in profit.  And millions in kickbacks to medical organizations and politicians for payoffs.<br><br>I\u2019m said to say my profession has failed the world and let down our community.<br><br>If you are young and healthy; whatever you do, don\u2019t take the vaccine.    If you have several co-morbidities.  <br><br>Then, consider taking the vaccine after weighing  the side effects and the COVID19 risks very carefully with your physician.  <br><br>Research COVID vaccines extensively.  If you decide to get the vaccine; I would suggest getting a non-mRNA version.<br><br>Stay safe everyone",

There are US$100millions of successful claims which is the tip of the iceberg but this keeps the US at the forefront in the profitable business of vaccine manufacture. The decision to approve the Pfizer vaccine was a commercial one. When the Brits ignored the science and approved the UK version the US had to also ignore the science or the UK would take the market for this new cheap easy to produce very profitable product IF IT WORKED .Which clearly it does not.It&#39;s not a vaccine in the true sense.

The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son: the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him. Ezekiel 18:20<br> <br>READ: Ezekiel 18:1-4.<br>1The word of the Lord came unto me again, saying, <br>2 What mean ye, that ye use this proverb concerning the land of Israel, saying, The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children&#39;s teeth are set on edge? <br>3 As I live, saith the Lord God, ye shall not have occasion any more to use this proverb in Israel. <br>4 Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine: the soul that sinneth, it shall die. <br> <br>MESSAGE:<br>The righteousness of God demands that the soul that commits sin would die as we see in our memory verse today. John 10:10 however gives us an alternative to sin and death:<br>\u201cThe thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.\u201d<br> <br>When we accept Jesus Christ as our Lord and Savior, He saves us from the life of sin, and ultimately eternal death, blessing us with abundant life instead.<br> <br>Another truth I want to share with us is that the righteousness of God does not allow an offender to be punished twice for one offense. Since Jesus Christ our Redeemer has suffered for our sins, we are discharged and acquitted. As long as you do not commit that sin again, once Jesus has forgiven you, your forgiveness is absolute.<br>\u201cSurely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted. But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.\u201d Isaiah 53:4-5<br> <br>Beloved, I am using this medium to appeal to you to come to Jesus Christ today and He will relieve you of your burden of sin. As a matter fact, the cross He carried before His crucifixion was for you and me. All you need to do is confess your sins and accept Jesus as your Savior and Lord. The Bible says if we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves and there is no truth is us (1 John 1:8). We deny ourselves the privilege of the great Burden-Bearer if we refuse to come to Him and make Him the Lord of our lives. He must be your Lord and Savior.<br> <br>I pray that the Almighty God will relieve you of every burden of sin and sorrow, in Jesus\u2019 name.<br> <br>PRAYER POINT: <br>Father, I bring my burden to You today in genuine repentance. Please forgive me and lift my burden today, in the mighty name of Jesus.",

If you take the vaccine \ud83d\udc89 that loses its effectiveness and you continue retake it over and over again your chances of the vaccine\u2019s unwanted side effects increase while only MINIMIZING the the effects of covid and it does nothing to prevent transmission. So how exactly is not getting the vaccine more dangerous? Is it because they\u2019re \u201cexperts\u201d and simply say so and thus it is gospel? I just don\u2019t get how anyone can say or report with a straight face \u201chowever the experts say it\u2019s more dangerous not to get the vaccine\u201d and not back that up with reasons behind that statement. The statement rests on what merits exactly? Faith in the experts? Which experts exactly? Who specialize what field exactly? Which experts exactly? Names? <br><br> You might as well say \u201cHowever, Bigbird said it\u2019s more dangerous not to get the vaccine, and he was wearing a lab coat when he said it he looked really, really, REALLY official and sounded VERY serious too\u201d.<br><br> Who the hell gives a damn about \u201cexperts\u201d and their opinions when their  opinions are not backed by anything of substance?",

The vaccine producers  seized the opportunity to embark on a program to put billions into their coffers while everyone submitted to coercive tactics designed to get compliance.<br><br> They succeeded but not because everyone who got vaccinated were fully informed and were convinced it was the answer. They made sure they wouldn&#39;t lose all their profits by enforcing conditions and making everyone sign a waiver granting them immunity from responsibility for any harms arising out of the decision of people to get vaccinated.<br><br>And they succeeded. One country after another, has in desperation, followed the advice of the &quot; experts&quot; . They copied each other and improvised on the original blueprint for persuasion.<br><br>Vaccine passports indeed! Apartheid? Yes indeed.Exclision of people who refuse it. Fines for elderly people who refuse it in Greece. It&#39;s out of control. The fear generated by the media has made it worse than the disease itself. A high recovery rate for those who got it. Natural immunity for most who got it negating the requirement for vaccination. In some places forcing people to get jabbed anyway.<br>They used a very effective psychological ploy to get the desired result. Not only that, <br>they primed  people to accept the idea that regular boosters would be needed to keep them protected. <br>People even accepted that the vaccines were not a guarantee of protection when more became known about its efficacy.<br>Many trust the vaccine makers and refuse to question their integrity. The government&#39;s worldwide have been forced to know tow to the corporation&#39;s. Shouldn&#39;t it have been the other way around?<br><br>There&#39;s a good reason why people have protested in great numbers on the streets <br>of the world&#39;s big cities. They are fearful of the future in the face of the attack on their freedom of choice. They are fearful of what will happen to their children if they are vaccinated. Fear is a great motivator.<br><br>On the one hand you have the unvaccinated fearful of the effects of the vaccines.<br><br>On the other hand you have the vaccinated fearful of what will happen if they refuse to be vaccinated.<br><br>Fear of dying. Fear of losing employment. Fear of being unable to see loved ones. Fear of not being able to travel, eat out, go to the movies, go to big sporting events. Fear of not being able to go about the ordinary activities of life one takes for granted.<br><br>There is so much fodder for discussion here, but that is not encouraged. Most people trust the professionals to do no harm.<br>Whether they deserve to be trusted is questionable.",

I&#39;m not against vaccines, although since the beginning I lack transparency from those of Covid-19, and that&#39;s worrying, but even though I gave it a try, specially by the restrictions here in Germany because being new around and restricted is hard to go through, and after all this, I can say that the third and on shots won&#39;t get me, specially if nothing is changing regarding transparency, which I believe it won&#39;t, therefore I will become, much likely, restricted from Feb. and on :), since I believe that there will be no exceptions for &#39;exceptional&#39; people ..",

These numbers are small (30-60 people) out of 10 million.  Everything is about risk/benefit (obviously).  The risk of dying in a plane crash is 1 in 16 million.  I&#39;m willing to fly with that risk.  GBS (Guillain Barre Syndrome) can occur after infections or vaccines (not just COVID vaccines)--basically if you introduce something to trigger the immune system sometimes the immune system will respond in a bad/overboard way and cause something like GBS rather than having a more focused response (eg just forming antibodies to the antigens in the vaccine).  I don&#39;t think this report should sway most people from getting vaccinated.  What I would say is: know Jesus--he&#39;s the only way to be safe for eternity.  And for vaccines: if you have a history of autoimmune disease think and pray about it more.  But I don&#39;t think these are really strong numbers to discourage vaccination for most folks.",

Why are they sitting and staying with these known harmful vaccines? They should be hurrying to move away from them and pull all of them out of circulation and replace them quickly with the Valneva , or Novavax , or something better known. They have had time to create a safer vaccine. Trash these mnra vaccines. They are proving harmful, just as the citizens of this world knew they would be. Practice strict safety protocols until we do. I would rather, double mask, sanitize, wear gloves, distance, isolate from friends and family if need be, than risk my health and life with either covid virus , or current available mnra vaccines . It\u2019s dangerous either way you slice it. It is literally a game of Russian roulette. Pull the trigger and just pray you don\u2019t get the bullet. You may live, you may die, or you may loose limbs, or you may have to suffer the rest of your life , either shorter or long, or you may just die, or you may have never contracted covid and been okay. Horrible , horrible situation for all of us. We have to think of something better. Surely , someone can. Woe to those , who knowingly , did this to the innocent people of this world. The angst they have put upon us all  , unduly. It is beyond shameful and unforgivable. This virus was not worth it . It should of never been. The entire world will never be the same. Non of us have the peaceful freedom to enjoy our lives and this planet as we once did. Man and his insatiable greed always destroys everything. It is always best, to leave life alone. Man should never try to play God. It always proves disastrous. When is it ever enough? Money and power. The root of all EVIL.  DESTROY THE WHOLE WORLD TO GAIN THE ALMIGHTY DOLLAR, or the ability to beat your chest and cry that your in control? . THEN WHAT HAVE YOU TO SPEND IT ON, when there is no life , no food, no air, no water, no people, no animals, no JOY IN LIFE? Without certain things in place, life cannot continue. When you disrupt Mother Nature, you damage the ability for life to exist. When you damage one thing in the grand scheme of things, it disrupts everything. If you destroy any part of the planet, it affects the whole planet. There should of never been an allowance for anything to have the power to destroy any part of our planet,  or it\u2019s people in such a way. It\u2019s dire consequences affect us all. It\u2019s not worth it. If there are no people , animals, insects , ground, water, seed , sun , or air, how do you grow food? Leaders really need to step back and rethink their measures for control. Modern day warfare is not at all the way to go , if life is to continue on this planet and be healthy and fruitful. It seems there are some that can\u2019t see the forest for the trees, or would , as the saying goes, ....cut off  their nose despite their own face. Their struggle for power will destroy us \u201cALL\u201d and the earth with it, or in the very least, compromise us all to the point and place that life isn\u2019t worth living . This corona virus may very well do that. There are some genies that don\u2019t go back into the bottle once they are out and continue to cause serious damage from now on. I can\u2019t help but wonder what price this is going to cost all human life from now on? I shutter to think.",

I knew people who died from it, yet there were always people willing to take it despite the warnings (or lack thereof in some cases).  My point is that there are always side effects from drugs.  Even aspirin can be dangerous.  Pain meds like Ibuprophen can cause high blood pressure and stomach, liver, and kidney problems.  Who knows what the final results will be for the Covid Vaccines years from now?  I chose to take it due to my age and for other reasons, but I can understand why some will choose not to take it.

Leaders who take that choice away should be charged with murder if someone should die of the vaccine and companies should be held accountable and have to pay restitution to the family.

How can you expect a vaccine created in less than a year to be fully tested and safe ? They say it is though . But my question is this , If you only studied this vaccine for a short time (1 year ) then how can they know the side effects five years from now if the only studied were done in that small year time frame . Most vaccines take 7-10 years to develop . They have specific guidelines to how a vaccines in normally made . But this vaccine was developed for emergency use and still IS NOT FDA approved! Even if it was tho the FDA is a complete joke and if u think they actually do their job then your a fool too . If the government cant even run the mail, social security, count ballots right and yall gonna really trust these greedy evil manipulative people ?? No thanks im good",

But they are using him as a scapegoat to draw attention away from the bigger picture, that this is a globalist takeover of the world and genocide. This calls for a Neuremberg style trial. The problem is finding who is in on it to prosecute them, and who is not in on it to conduct the trial.<br><br>Jesus is the only refuge from the storm that is coming. Take it seriously. This is your Christmas present. The following is just my opinion about what is going on right now. So, if you don&#39;t like what I&#39;m saying, just ignore it. It&#39;s just what I think, about what I see happening among us.<br><br>It started over a year and a half ago with, &quot;two weeks to flatten the curve.&quot; Everything they did was designed to turn this into a pandemic. The masks, shut downs, social distancing, and now vaccines do nothing but drag out a virus that should have been finished a year ago, if they had let nature take it&#39;s natural course. It never even would have begun if they hadn&#39;t created the virus in the first place.<br><br>Once you start this, you will have to take their shots for the rest of your life, which probably won&#39;t be that long. They are already saying you may have to take them every year. Which means you will. What this will do is destroy your natural immunity and you will be dependent like a drug addict. It is already resulting in deaths from strokes and heart attacks. In the longer term, it will result in cancers and autoimmune diseases.<br><br>You cannot get herd immunity by taking a vaccine. You cannot get herd immunity by vaccinating 100% of the people on earth. By taking a vaccine, you only turn your immune system into a one trick pony. As soon as the virus mutates, the vaccine becomes useless, and you have to come up with a new vaccine. That is exactly what is happening with the delta variant. The ONLY WAY to get herd immunity is through the natural immune system. So, if you want this thing to drag out indefinitely, take the vaccine. Guess what! The people pushing the vaccines know that.<br><br>I&#39;ll go one further. The U.S. did fund the development of deadly viruses in Wuhan, China. And the Covid 19 pandemic did begin in Wuhan, China. But that was just a little coincidence. Of all the places in the world that the virus could have emerged, it just happened to be there. Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain. They develop deadly viruses so that they can study them and then develop vaccines to combat them. Does that make any sense? It sounds like a protection racket to me. You are taking your health advise and now mandatory orders, from the same people who I believe made the virus in the first place.<br><br>ModeRNA (mRNA) never had a single drug on the market before they came up with this vaccine. Three different drug companies were somehow able to simultaneously develop the vaccines in record time. That is because the vaccine formula was already developed before the genocide. I&#39;m not afraid to say it. This was never a pandemic. It is a genocide.<br><br>Frankenscience! Where do people think the mRNA comes from in the vaccines? The problem is they don&#39;t think about it. They cannot make mRNA from scratch. It comes from the cloned cells of aborted human babies. Basically they have a test tube baby farm, growing human cells in vitro, from which they extract the DNA and RNA.<br><br>Timeline of events.<br><br>DARPA:  Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency is the mad scientist branch of the U.S. Defence Department. They are responsible for developing all of the mass murder technologies that the U.S. has at it&#39;s disposal.<br><br>In 2014, DARPA funneled over $3 million through an NGO called Eco Health Alliance to the Wuhan Institute of Virology for gain of function research. Gain of function is engineering a virus to be more contagious to humans.<br><br>In November of 2019, the World Economic Forum, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security hosted &quot;Event 201&quot;, wargaming a pandemic preparedness exercise, which &quot;predicted&quot; the current &quot;pandemic.&quot;<br><br>The first cases of Covid-19 began appearing in December 2019 in, of all places, Wuhan, China. The propaganda spread faster than the virus. By January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a &quot;public health emergency of international concern.&quot;<br><br>In March of 2020, Trump gave ModeRNA (mRNA) $482 million to develop a vaccine under what he called &quot;Operation Warp Speed&quot;. Sure enough, they had a vaccine ready for trial by July 2020. Amazing! Of course, all of that money came from DARPA. Because, that&#39;s what they do.<br><br>Earlier in 2019, before the pandemic, the World Economic Forum in partnership with the Rockefeller Foundation started the &quot;Commons Project&quot;, to create an electronic vaccine passport system called &quot;CommonPass&quot;.<br><a href=\"https://thecommonsproject.org/commonpass?fbclid=IwAR3IMIb_A_-KyY5eOTR1sDwSWLzU_gyfCQhC96_OlO33X6bqdAof1-qy7q4\">https://thecommonsproject.org/commonpass?fbclid=IwAR3IMIb_A_-KyY5eOTR1sDwSWLzU_gyfCQhC96_OlO33X6bqdAof1-qy7q4</a>",

Only protection today is your own immunity, going thru COVID disease and than you will be protected. Data from hospitals showing us this fact today - vaccinated or not, in hospitals ends 10 time more pacients who wasnt really ill by COVID until now. Data from Israel - vaccinated : unvaccinated in hospitals - <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJvsp3Ayzss&amp;t=3345\">55:45</a> / deaths: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJvsp3Ayzss&amp;t=3050\">50:50</a>. In Czech Republic, one week data: 52 unvaccinated deaths, 47 vaccinated deaths. Vaccine really works ? So worst category of people heading (maybe, because they dont yet know their immunity resistance against COVID, maybe its only question of their genetics) - unvaccinated, not going thru COVID illness fo far. On other side here are voices that says last year COVID someone beats with no big symptoms, than vaccination and second COVID infection was much more brutal. So what ? &quot;ADE&quot; ?",

Now why is all this happening pretty simple Lee explained because half of you people voted for Biden you put this more on in office who is mandating that all Americans take the supposed vaccine liqueur the miracle cure that you&#39;ve all been waiting on and yet the administration turns around and invites to me and illegal people into our country and doesn&#39;t give them the cure and on top of that he wants to give them over $400,000 for mental abuse because we separated you from your child. Now it was wrong first of all that they came into our country and that he allowed them in here secondly it&#39;s incredibly wrong that we separate the parents from the child what kind of soul is cruel creature does that? And number three people are surprised seriously you&#39;re surprised that their side effects that the pharmaceutical companies didn&#39;t tell you about it makes me seriously wonder your mental capability if you really believe that these pharmaceutical companies aren&#39;t getting something out of this.",

The pro vaxxers want to believe that the government won&#39;t harm them by giving them a vaccine that can kill. The anti vaxxers want to believe that the government won&#39;t harm them by creating a virus that can kill. Both believe that the government will play fair enough to give us a way out. That either the vaccine is safe or the virus is nothing. No one seems to ever want to think that maybe both are lethal? Why will people not face this inconvenient truth that maybe we are actually in a stalemate position? I think that both the virus and vaccine are designed to kill, that we are not given a way out. I have realised that this is not a physical predicament at all but a spiritual one. Who will you trust? Who can deliver you? I have already put my trust outside of this world. I trust Jesus Christ to deliver me. This is just like the scene in the Exodus. The virus is the Pharaoh and his men riding towards us to maim and kill. The vaccine is taking our chances in the Red Sea. We may be able to swim to the other side but we may drown. I am doing what Moses did. I am waiting on the Lord for my deliverance. I believe this is a huge test of people&#39;s faith. It&#39;s also a great opportunity for people to turn to God for their hope, not politicians, doctors and scientist.",

According to the right statistical journals (which is non funded by big pharmaceuticals), ARR (Absolute Risk Reduction) of all COVID 19 vaccines is around 1 % and NNV (Number Need to Vaccinated in order to prevent 1 more infection) is 80-100 people. The figures all media talk about is RRR (Relative Risk Reduction) didn&#39;t consider large population baseline background numbers of placebo groups. That&#39;s why the efficacy % is too high which if over exaggerated. Therefore, all marketed vaccines are pretty useless to prevent COVID 19 infections, especially when considering life threatening, debilitating side effects. COVID 19 is not serious or dangerous any more, only elderlies or people believe themselves have weak immunity can have vaccines, but others do not have to. Will do more serious harm than benefit, especially younger generations.",

That term is highly subjective. Also, the word &quot;healthy&quot; is thrown around a lot. Like an article that says a &quot;healthy&quot; person died of covid. Then you look at their picture and they&#39;re obese and then further down in the article, it says they have asthma or high blood pressure. Like what does the word &quot;healthy&quot; mean to people? If you&#39;re walking around and you&#39;re alive, you&#39;re somehow &quot;healthy?&quot; We need an actual definition to these words. Is 1 in a million rare? Is 1 in a hundred thousand rare? I think that&#39;s why so many people are arguing. Everyone has a different definition for these words.",

As the consequence of their rejections disasters have been coming down on them ever since, just check the history. Also the authorities in the whole world and their spying agencies do not allow their media talk about the discovery of secret &quot;Code-19&quot; in the Arabic Quran because they want you to be busy with those 4200 fake, false and manmade religions. You must know that whatever you have learned about Religion is Not in the Scientifically Proven Arabic Quran. That is why people hate Religion. Remember, we are not talking about today\u2019s sheytanic cult called \u201cIslam\u201d. As the consequence of hiding those miracles the whole world has been suffering from so many disasters ever since 46 years ago. Then, couple of years ago the whole world has been suffering from &quot;Covid-19&quot; (Q 44) which it has been stamped with the number &quot;19&quot; by the Almighty Creator.
