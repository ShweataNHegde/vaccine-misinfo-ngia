The body thinks that the perfectly normal thing like pollen or food is really harmful to your body, so it desperately fights against it, by sneezing in the mildest forms or swelling things like the throat which is the dangerous part...<br><br>Vaccines do have ingredients and people can be allergic to some of them and allergic reactions are amplified if you inject the ingredients into your bloodstream... My doctor did look at the ingredients of the vaccine and checked it against my list of allergies and there were no matches... Just in case, they did prepare me so they can inject the medicine against allergic reactions very quickly if one were to come up...

They would take actual matter such as pus from someone infected and scrape/cut it into the skin of a person.  Since Smallpox was normally passed on via inhalation rather than via the skin that &quot;slowed&quot; the capacity of the virus to quickly infect cells and replicate in the body = giving the immune system time to mount a response and defeat it.<br><br>The problem however was 2-fold.  First was depending upon when in the infection the &quot;donee&quot; was and how much matter was used as well as the manner of scraping/cutting the skin could impact how severely infected a person might become.  The second problem was it used actual Smallpox.  As such some people went on to develop full blown Smallpox rather than a milder form of the illness as was typical with subsequent mortality rates being ~5% - albeit still lower than the usual 20-30% of people infected with Smallpox normally.  <br><br>What Jenner deduced was that people infected with Cowpox did not then develop Smallpox = hence &quot;cross-reactivity&quot;.  Jenner devised introducing Cowpox - which was not typically harmful for humans - rather than variolating using actual Smallpox matter.  He inoculated Phipps - probably via scraping or poking him with a needle dipped in Cowpox matter.  Then he later variolated him as would have happened anyways at some point - children like adults were variolated during Smallpox epidemics.  When Phipps did not react to variolation as he should have - blister(s) and malaise and fever - Jenner realized he was immune.  \ud83e\udd14<br><br>p.s. - Smallpox vaccine using Cowpox was administered various ways until the 1960&#39;s.  It was during the global Smallpox eradication effort when the bifurcated needle was developed for use.  It would be dipped into a vial of liquid vaccine and then the person&#39;s arm would be quickly punctured 4-5X in a short, stabbing motion.  <br><br>This proved superior to inoculation or similar puncturing of the skin as well as reduced the amount of vaccine medium required.  That meant that a vial of vaccine could then vaccinated many more individuals than if it was drawn up with a hypodermic needle and injected."

Thus Phipps would have been variolated anyways at some point as that was common practice back then.<br><br>Moral of the story:  so Jenner exposed the boy to Cowpox - which was not particularly dangerous and which people would catch anyways as a result of handling dairy cattle.  He then variolated the boy as would have happened anyways.  When the boy did not react to variolation as people typically did - fevers and blisters = he knew the boy was already immune.

What we are providing all of you is: an \u2018EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGICAL GENE THERAPY IMMUNE-MODULATORY INJECTION\u2019. We are injecting a SYNTHETIC form of nucleic acid. It is considered a \u2018MEDICAL DEVICE and therefore DOES NOT fall under the definition of a \u2018vaccine\u2019 &quot;<br><br>If I&#39;m Pregnant, and I discuss this with my doctor are they required to document the risks and benefits of the vaccine in my patient chart?<br>Govt: &quot;NO, Although we (the Govt. and Vaccine companies have complete freedom from liability, your doctor may be held liable for your care during your pregnancy and delivery. So we (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists- ACOG) thought it would be best to not require your doctor to document if they had this discussion with you so that there be no obstacles between you and receiving the vaccine. But if something BAD did happen after your jab, you won&#39;t be able to put the blame on your doctor because they would not have any documentation that they had this discussion with you.  In the end, your body, your choice.\u201d<br><br>Were there any \u2018INDEPENDENT\u2019 Observer groups (without any conflict of interest) looking at the data during the initial trials?<br>Govt: &quot;NO&quot;<br><br>I get vaccinated can I stop wearing a mask(s)?<br>Govt: &quot;NO&quot;<br><br>If I get vaccinated will the restaurants, bars, schools, fitness clubs, hair salons, etc. reopen and will people be able to get back to work like normal?<br>Govt: &quot;NO&quot;<br><br>If I get vaccinated will I be resistant to Covid?<br>Govt: &quot;Maybe. We don&#39;t know exactly, but probably not.&quot;<br><br>If I get vaccinated, at least I won&#39;t be contagious to others - right?<br>Govt: &quot;NO. the vaccine doesn\u2019t stop transmission.&quot;<br><br>If I get vaccinated, how long will the vaccine last?<br>Govt: &quot;No one knows. All \u2018Covid vaccines\u2019 are still in the experimental stage. Maybe 3-9 months?&quot;<br><br>If I get vaccinated, can I stop social distancing?<br>Govt: &quot;NO&quot;<br>If my parents, grandparents and myself all get vaccinated can we hug each other again?<br>Govt: &quot;NO&quot; EDIT: GOVERNMENT: YES<br><br>So what&#39;s the benefit of getting vaccinated?<br>Govt: &quot;Hoping that the virus won&#39;t kill you, and you get to VIRTUE SIGNAL to all the world via social media!!!&quot;<br><br>Are you sure the vaccine won&#39;t injure or kill me?<br>Govt: &quot;NO, there is not enough longitudinal data.  YOU may suffer a brain stroke though. It\u2019s still under EUA due to lack of safety data&quot;<br><br>If statistically the virus won&#39;t kill me (99.7% survival rate), why should I get vaccinated?<br>Govt: &quot;To protect others&quot;<br><br>If I get vaccinated, I can protect 100% of people I come in contact with?&quot;<br>Govt: &quot;NO&quot;<br><br>If I get the vaccine, I and I get exposed to the original or other variants I should be fine right?<br>Govt.: \u201cNO\u201d- It is possible that you may have a hyper-immune reaction known as the \u2018Cytokine storm\u2019 when you eventually get exposed sometime at a later date after your vaccination.<br><br>If I do experience a severe adverse reaction, long term effects (still unknown) or die from the vaccine will I (or my family) be compensated from the vaccine manufacturer or the Government?<br>Govt: &quot;NO - the government and vaccine manufacturers have 100% zero liability regarding this experimental drug&quot;<br><br>There isn\u2019t any conflict of interest between the Government and the Vaccine industry  is there?<br>Govt: \u201cNO. But we (NIH) do co-hold the PATENT for this \u2018Vaccine\u2019 with Moderna\u201d<br><br>Is there a safe and effective alternative to the vaccine?<br>Govt: \u201cofficially-NO\u201d  If we \u2018officially\u2019 acknowledge IVERMECTIN as an effective treatment, we would be obligated to revoke the EAU status of all the vaccines. <br>In summary, the Covid19 vaccine...<br>\u2022Does not have any data on the safety of efficacy on pregnant women or the unborn child.<br>\u2022Does not provide immunity<br>\u2022Does not eliminate the virus<br>\u2022Does not prevent death<br>\u2022Does not guarantee you won\u2019t get it<br>\u2022Does not stop you from passing it on to others<br>\u2022Does not eliminate the need for travel bans<br>\u2022Does not eliminate the need for business closures<br>\u2022Does not eliminate the need for lockdowns<br>\u2022Does not eliminate the need for masking<br>\u2022Does have the possibility of a hyper-immune reaction known as the \u2018Cytokine storm\u2019 because of your Covid vaccination<br>\u2022 NIH co-holds the PATENT for mRNA Vaccine with ModerRNA (The fox watching the hen-house)<br>\u2022 Does not meet the definition of a vaccine: \u2018mRNA Vaccine\u2019 Jab is an \u2018EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGICAL GENE THERAPY IMMUNE-MODULATORY INJECTION\u2019<br>-Consider prophylaxis and early treatment with Ivermectin.

I was\u00a0 once a herpes positive, I will forever be grateful to God Almighty and\u00a0Dr Elinfoh Herbal Home\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0for reaching me when I thought it was all over, Today I am happy with my family living free. After the medical doctor confirmed Herpes status Negative, after 3 weeks on Dr Elinfoh\u00a0 herbs . I have never in my life believed that herpes\u00a0 could be cured by any herbal medicine i first doubted but i have no choice but to trust and believe him and today i am happy to say i am Herpes free, He can as well cure the following disease;\u00a0<br>HERPES SIMPLEX VIRUS 1&amp;2 [HSV]<br>CANCER<br>ASTHMA<br>CHRONIC DISEASE<br>LUPUS<br>DIABETICS 1&amp;2<br>FIBROMYALGIA<br>HEPATITIS A, B,C<br>ARTHRITISFIBROID\u00a0I want to make sure that herpes never happens to anyone else. We can&#39;t prevent herpes\u00a0 by punishment, by stigma and discrimination. It&#39;s only through building a safe, supportive and caring environment, that positive people still have hope and they should contact Dr. Elinfoh via email: drelinfohherbalhome@gmail.com\u00a0Together we fight to become healthy. You can also call or Whatsapp him via his cell +2348110492072 THANKS .",

Will you be so surprised that you literally don&#39;t believe it didn&#39;t work, and then try to lie to yourself that the only possible reason it didn&#39;t work is because you didn&#39;t force everyone else to do the same? That is literally the \u201cherd immunity\u201d argument. My argument is simple.

As standard, the adaptive immunity is actually known as the 3rd line of defence, not the second line. the first line of defence is the physical, chemical and microbiological barriers to infection such as lysozyme in tears, hydrochloric acid in the stomach and the presence of keratinised, unbroken skin.  The second line is what happens once an infection has entered the body&#39;s systems, and includes actions such as inflammation response, general phagocytosis of pathogens and the action of complement. Therefore the 3rd line of defence is the adaptive response which is specific and has memory via the action of T and B lymphocytes. I used to always direct my 16-18yo students to TED videos but now I will reconsider. This video was far below my expectations.",

It seems quite obvious that humanity would not poison itself as many antivaccination supporters claim. Vaccination already saved modern generation from millions of deaths annually and many potential pandemics. Plague, polio, measles, variola, tetanus and many other lethal diseases are mainly beaten thanks to vaccination. Just google for facts.\r<br>2.\tThe second reason is that you will save others. Some people cannot get a vaccine due to health issues and only shield they have is vaccinated people with existing antibodies. Okay, if you don\u2019t care about them, get back to reason number one.\r<br>3.\tThe reason people now refuse to get the vaccine is that their standard of living became so high that many of them just forgot what it means to get seriously sick and that people perceive risks of developing side effect consequences to health as more significant is that they know and see them, but never saw plague or measles. People live a good life today and forget to thank vaccines for it.",

                "text": "Scientists use vaccines to trigger the body\u2019s adaptive immune system without exposing humans to the full strength disease. Basically to prepare before a disease enters the body. There are a lot of different type of vaccines. First, we have the live attenuated vaccines. This are made of the pathogen itself it a much weaker and tamer version. Then we have, inactive vaccines, in which the pathogens have been killed. The weakening and inactivation in both types of vaccine  ensures that photogenic don\u2019t develop into the full blown disease. They trigger an immune response teaching the body to recognize an attack by making a profile of pathogens in preparation. The down sides is that live attenuated vaccines can be difficult to make and because they are live and quite powerful, people with weaker immune system can\u2019t have them, while inactive vaccines don\u2019t create long-lasting immunity. Another type, the subunit vaccine. It is only made from on part of the pathogen called antigen, the ingredient that actually triggers the immune response. By even further isolating specific components of antigens, like proteins or polysaccharides, these vaccines can prompt specific responses. Scientists are building a new vaccine called DNA vaccine. For this variety, they isolate the very genes that make specific antigens the body needs to trigger its immune response to specific pathogens. When injected into the human body, those genes instruct cells in the body to make antigens. This causes a stronger immune response, and prepares the body for any future threats and because the vaccine only includes specific genetic material, it doesn\u2019t contain any other ingredients from the rest of the pathogen that could develop into the disease and harm the patient. If these vaccines become a success we might be able to build more effective treatments for invasive pathogens in years to come.",

After that there isn&#39;t much of a trend. The overall test for trend, which I think is in the text, is significantly negative. That is driven by this finding here.

So, when real disease enter the body, the antibody would kill it before it could wreack havoc.<br>And if your kids are ill after vaccination, take them to doctors and tell them that you just vaccinate ur kid.

It was a success.<br>The eight-year-old was inoculated against the disease and this became the first ever vaccine.<br>But why did it work?<br>To understand how vaccines function, we need to know how the immune system defends us against contagious diseases in the first place.<br>When foreign microbes invade us, the immune system triggers a series of responses in an attempt to identify and remove them from our bodies.<br>The signs that this immune response is working are the coughing, sneezing, inflammation and fever we experience, which work to trap, deter and rid the body of threatening things, like bacteria.<br>These innate immune responses also trigger our second line of defense, called adaptive immunity.<br>Special cells called B cells and T cells are recruited to fight microbes, and also record information about them, creating a memory of what the invaders look like, and how best to fight them.<br>This know-how becomes handy if the same pathogen invades the body again. But despite this smart response, there&#39;s still a risk involved.<br>The body takes time to learn how to respond to pathogens and to build up these defenses.<br>And even then, if a body is too weak or young to fight back when it&#39;s invaded, it might face very serious risk if the pathogen is particularly severe.<br>But what if we could prepare the body&#39;s immune response, readying it before someone even got ill?<br>This is where vaccines come in.<br>Using the same principles that the body uses to defend itself, scientists use vaccines to trigger the body&#39;s adaptive immune system, without exposing humans to the full strength disease.<br>This has resulted in many vaccines, which each work uniquely, separated into many different types.<br>First, we have live attenuated vaccines. These are made of the pathogen itself but a much weaker and tamer version.<br>Next, we have inactive vaccines, in which the pathogens have been killed.<br>The weakening and inactivation in both types of vaccine ensures that pathogens don&#39;t develop into the full blown disease. But just like a disease, they trigger an immune response, teaching the body to recognize an attack by making a profile of pathogens in preparation.<br>The downside is that live attenuated vaccines can be difficult to make, and because they&#39;re live and quite powerful, people with weaker immune systems can&#39;t have them, while inactive vaccines don&#39;t create long-lasting immunity.<br>Another type, the subunit vaccine, is only made from one part of the pathogen, called an antigen, the ingredient that actually triggers the immune response. By even further isolating specific components of antigens, like proteins or polysaccharides, these vaccines can prompt specific responses.",

The maidens believed they would be immune to small pox by catching the cow pox. NOT the same virus.  Jenner&#39;s &quot;vaccine&quot; was to take the pus of cowpox and smear it upon the lanced skin of a patient.  That was it.  That was the &quot;scientific test.&quot;  Because the boy did not become sick with small pox when smeared after with small pox - THAT was the test that determined the fate of vaccines.  Doctors of the time wrote that the spread of small pox and other diseases like diphtheria, syphilis, and cholera and others was because of this smearing of pus cowpox and from pus small pox.  There was heavy controversy and protest at that time, so much so that a mandate for forced vaccination was ruled or fines and imprisonment.  Many were jailed.  There was no &quot;science.&quot;  This does not equate to immunity, as not all people became sick from small pox of those living with them, or those caring for them like nurses without vaccination.  There were no double-blind, placebo studies at that time.  And no blood work either, as the bacteria or virus of the small pox could NOT BE DETERMINED.  AT THAT TIME they could not find the organism that PRODUCED small pox!  So how could they be scientifically assured that it was the small pox organism that was being &quot;eradicated&quot; with the vaccine, when that nor any antibodies could be identified???  How did they know it was not just the person&#39;s immune system?   And every diseases where no vaccine is available, the disease outbreak always wanes on it&#39;s own.  Like Ebola and others.  So how do we know the quieting of a disease is because of a vaccine?  No double-blind, placebo study has ever been performed for ANY EXISTING VACCINE.  THAT is not science-based as what they have us believe.  Research that.",

There is also studies that show that when  children with autism are  given the anti anti-antibiotics symptoms were decreased a lot. There&#39;s a lot of new research on the microbiology of the gut and how it can cause depression in fact some probiotics can actually have the same effect as anti depressants. If you do not believe me please watch &quot;what I&#39;ve learnt&quot; &#39;s video on the gut and the brain.<br><br>I think it is a risk but a good one to take because the sicknesses that are prevented are deadly but its not logical to say that there is no chance of harm and you should 100% trust it.",

A lot of Doctors who are never taught about vaccines in Medical school  also do not know anything about Vaccines as they are only taught the Vaccine Schedule of when vaccines are due to be given. Even Doctors once they do their own research then come to understand the inherent problems with vaccines and some have changed careers to expose the dangers. Many that have put time into the research realise that there are many unanswered questions and it is not as simple as this 7.22 video suggests. Instead of name calling and bad language that mostly seems to be the case with fearful, ignorant people that believe in vaccines, just do your own research into proper studies that are real, that have not got  a another agenda behind them.",

Because of how vaccines work, people sometimes view them as counterintuitive. Because vaccines work by injecting a person with a small amount of the disease, or diseases, they are being protected against, people question how it works. When people are injected with the vaccine, it is common to experience side effects such as coughing, sneezing, inflammation, and fever. These symptoms, which are most commonly associated with becoming sick, sometimes make people feel like the vaccine is doing the opposite of what it is supposed to be doing. They go in trying to protect their kid from getting sick, so they often wonder why their kid starts to show signs of developing a cold or flu. These symptoms can easily be explained by what they are doing. They are working to trap things like bacteria and get rid of them from the body. After that, adaptive immunity kicks in and programs the body to get rid of these types of bacteria if they are introduced to the body in the future. Though the process and symptoms may seem harmful to parents, they are actually helping the child. When children are vaccinated against diseases, they have the opportunity to live a healthier life.",

Later, Edward Jenner went to a Dairy Farm and saw a Dairy Farmer. The woman said she would NEVER get smallpox because she had already gotten CowPox. Jenner saw this and thought that Cow Pox and Small Pox were related. The symptoms of cow pox on humans were WAY less severe. The son of one of the dairy farmers was willing to help so Jenner injected Cow Pox into the boy and the next days he was sick but after that, he NEVER got small pox even when Jenner injected him with it.

It is twisted genius in action, making intelligent, independent-thinking people ignore their honest, well-founded vaccine skepticism, and causing the rest to accept unlimited vaccinations without question.<br><br>\u00a0There are two primary reasons why vaccinating oneself cannot protect others, and why failing to vaccinate cannot endanger others. The first is from the science of immunology, and we can describe it as waning antibody stimulation, post-vaccination. In short, vaccines only do one thing-stimulate antibody production to something similar but not the same as the infection. That antibody stimulation is temporary, lasting only a few months or years. So the majority of the US population has had no so-called vaccine &quot;protection&quot; for several decades, without any resurgent epidemics of measles, mumps, pertussis, etc.<br><br>The second is from the science of population outcomes, or epidemiology. In all populations globally who have ever attained the ever-rising and completely arbitrary (made up) minimum threshold for vaccine uptake (% of a population who get vaccinated), outbreaks of vaccinated diseases still occur. This should, of course, be impossible, if herd immunity were actually true.",

That means most people will only be X% protected by the vaccines after 10 years. Wouldn\u2019t their be massive outbreaks already? That means most of the population who has been vaccinated aren\u2019t protected.<br><br>#2. If herd immunity theory is correct why are so many people who are vaccinated (protected) so scared if people who aren\u2019t vaccinated (not protected) if in fact the vaccines are so effective?<br><br>#3 Has anyone clearly communicated why vaccines are so full of questionable ingredients? I have not found anyone to explain this. MRC-5? For example? Or any of the other nasty\u2019s in there?<br><br>#4 I have heard a lot of pro vaccination people claim they want to criminalize people who don\u2019t vaccinate because it can harm other people\u2026If you believe in this yet also argue that vaccines are not 100% safe as the media and dr\u2019s claim as well as are not 100% affective, aren\u2019t you criminalizing something that is not yet understood much less can be controlled?",

I do not care what you think, believe or anything at all. You can stay asleep. Good night! I know where I am, I know what I know, I know I have a gift and why I am fu(ked with. I know how to handle it for the most part. I do not \u201cthink you would understand nor do I expect anyone especially who\u2019s in line their whole life. Who believes everything they are brainwashed to believe. I do not wis to waste any more time on anyone where it I unwanted or needed.

You have not seen brilliant until you meet these guys I\u2019m facing.  But go carry on, be in shock, I hope you never meet and if you do, best advice is,  you have control over it, do not panic, it lives and senses when you\u2019re feared up. And gets heavier.

To support your argument you make massive assumptions that if disproven would instantly destroy your argument. I am not at all in shock, I am sleeping in my bed, and getting better rather quickly. Guess who isn&#39;t though, the people who didn&#39;t get vaccinated. One of them is hospitalized as we speak, God help their souls. I, and everyone else there who was vaccinated, is recovering rather quickly. I have lost my fever, my stuffy nose, and I reckon this will be over by the end if the day. I am not brainwashed, not at all. I never trust anything until I have evidence. That&#39;s why I didn&#39;t get the vaccine until 6 months ago whrn I received overwhelming evidence that you must have not come across yet. I read countless articles, watched countless videos, and even observed those with the vaccine. My conclusion from it? Thr covid vaccine is like any other vaccine. There is nothing bad about it, it can only help you. Go ahead and call people sheep, as you blindly listen to other wackos validate your argument, and trust them completely. Don&#39;t you think it&#39;s a bit hypocritical to call people sheep, or brainwashed, when you yourself blindly trust a minority of the population, who I would bet you money don&#39;t even understand what they speak of? I once again being up the fact that Tibetan bowls and cosmic healing are in your subscribed to list. You follow people who spread misconceptions that would be laughed at by anyone with actual knowledge of the subject. What else, do you believe in healing rocks? You need mental help at this point, these are crazy conspiracies eith nothing to back them but am argument as strong as a toddler. Please, get help, look at the actual facts, and think deeply. Who is actually brainwashed here? There must be a reason why everyone on planet earth disagrees with you, go do some research and figure out why."

National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act\r<br>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\r<br>Jump to navigationJump to search\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (NCVIA) of 1986 (42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 300aa-1 to 300aa-34) was signed into law by United States President Ronald Reagan as part of a larger health bill on November 14, 1986. NCVIA&#39;s purpose was to eliminate the potential financial liability of vaccine manufacturers due to vaccine injury claims[1] to ensure a stable market supply of vaccines, and to provide cost-effective arbitration for vaccine injury claims.[2] Under the NCVIA, the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (NVICP) was created to provide a federal no-fault system for compensating vaccine-related injuries or death by establishing a claim procedure involving the United States Court of Federal Claims and special masters.[1][3]",

I think the hesitation and refusal to get vaccinated isn\u2019t simply because we don\u2019t recall the horrors of the diseases.<br><br>Rather it\u2019s the tap dance doctors do to avoid answering certain questions. It\u2019s the sense that no one wants to acknowledge the people who do have severe illness due to vaccines. Let me give a couple examples.<br><br>I believe it was 2012 when members of the military were about to deploy to Middle East. They were required to get the anthrax vaccine and small pox vaccine. Immediately several<br>Soldiers had negative effects. All of which is documented in their military medical records. It took decades for them to finally get diagnosed with disease impacting the heart (it\u2019s often misdiagnosed as severe heartburn). The illnesses they had were on the black box warning, yet the military and VA refuse to recognize these issues as qualifying for VA healthcare. All sides agree on vaccines received. All sides agree immediate medical effects were reported. All sides agree that the illnesses that were finally diagnosed are known side effects. Yet they refuse to provide these soldiers with healthcare.  (Please, don\u2019t take my word for it, research it, it\u2019s not hard to find).<br><br>Another example of questionable trust centers around the measles vaccine (MMR),  Rarely will doctors truly explain possible side effects and failures. No one can explain why some people who are completely vaccinated will still become infected with measles. Or you have those people who were vaccinated in the 60\u2019s. Unbeknownst to patients, the vaccine given back then was found to be ineffective. Yet most people have no clue that they\u2019re walking around with no immunity.<br><br>All in all, there is a serious lack of transparency when it comes to vaccines. Then you have those who are vaccinated but still infected, yet medical community will do everything it can to avoid accepting that responsibility.<br><br>Most people, parents especially, want to protect our kids. But when programs are done in such suspect manner, it\u2019s hard to decide which is the greater evil.<br><br>As for those who choose to not be vaccinated, that\u2019s their choice. That\u2019s also a choice they\u2019ll have to shoulder if/when they or their families become infected. <br><br>Regardless of your view/choice, each person wants to make the right choice. But there is a lot of mistrust floating in the medical community. I think we\u2019d see much better results if the topic of side effects were discussed openly, honestly and allow each person to make the best informed decision they can.",

He counts on the naive and trusting to not think it was just some strange slip of the tongue.  \r<br>\r<br>The phrase &quot;the final solution&quot; was, of course, made famous through Nazis in regard to their eugenicist plan for exterminating Jews.  They also made &quot;essential services&quot; famous.  Of course the &quot;need&quot;for &quot;essential services&quot; was used to cull and control the populace.\r<br>\r<br> Gates and others working with him want to put invisible tattoos on children and others to track their &quot;health&quot; and vaccination records.  Now what are those tattoos reminescent of from last century?\r<br>\r<br>He is so interested in decreasing population, particularly in the vulnerable African countries.  Uh, who asked him to be a depopulation czar for our planet?  No one.  Why don&#39;t Bill and Melinda start depopulating with themselves?  Oh, wait.  We are supposed to assume that they are god like beings who get to make decisions for human &quot;population control&quot; in the world, while they are are above such consideration.  Another underlying assumption appears to be that people in Africa, especially, need to be stopped from reproducing more black people.\r<br>\r<br>The need to depopulate is a eugenicist myth.  If all the people in the world were to stand together in one place, they would fit into a large city easily.  All one has to do is fly over this country and other countries, including even little but highly productive Israel, and see the vast amount of empty, unpopulted, space that is out there.  \r<br>\r<br>Let&#39;s see.  Gates has a strong family background promoting eugenics.  He called his vaccine &quot;the final solution.&quot;  He wants to depopulate the world.  AND he wants you, with force if possible, to take his vaccine.  See any red flags there?\r<br>\r<br>This less than one minute vid, with the smirks on Bill&#39;s &amp; Melinda&#39;s faces, is incredibly creepy:    <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmP6_gy-MIE\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmP6_gy-MIE</a>  I&#39;ll quote a You Tuber here about this vid. &quot;The fact he smirks and claims the second one will get attention means this is orchestrated.&quot; \r<br>\r<br>Here is a video with Senator Robert Kennedy Jr. vs Alan Deshowtiz.  Kennedy gives tons of hard core data about how harmful vaccines are.  Derschowitz gives the dracononian party line.\r<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfnJi7yLKgE\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfnJi7yLKgE\r</a><br>\r<br>See the movie Vaxxed on You Tube.

Let me reiterate with an example, just because a pill like Viagra works it does not justify something like opioids. Today we have way more vaccines than we did 50 years ago. Vaccines like MMR and HPV are no where near as safe nor understood as something like the polio vaccine. Also adjuvants are in each vaccine and no one understands the effects of adjuvants building up in people\u2019s tissues over time. Current analysis says adjuvants leave the system within weeks of injection. They came to this conclusion based on blood tests showing decreasing accumulations of adjuvants however they were not able to identify the adjuvants being expelled from the body from urination etc... we have however recently found adjuvant accumulation in organs and brain tissue. If adjuvants such as aluminum accumulate in brain tissue that could be the cause of Alzheimer\u2019s or other neurodevelopmental diseases. Again we cannot confirm this but if virologists are raising this concern so should the people who receive the vaccines. This is not an anti-vaxx comment it is rather a pro vaccine conversation comment. Discussion is the crux of scientific discovery and review.",

Thus, parents who vaccinate their children can indeed put others at risk,\u201d explains Leslie Manookian, documentary filmmaker and activist. Manookian\u2019s award winning documentary, The Greater Good, aims to open a dialog about vaccine safety.<br><br>Both unvaccinated and vaccinated individuals are at risk from exposure to those recently vaccinated. Vaccine failure is widespread; vaccine-induced immunity is not permanent and recent outbreaks of diseases such as whooping cough, mumps and measles have occurred in fully vaccinated populations.14,15\u00a0Flu vaccine recipients become more susceptible to future infection after repeated vaccination.16, 17<br><br>\u201cHealth officials should require a two-week quarantine of all children and adults who receive vaccinations,\u201d says Sally Fallon Morell, president of the Weston A. Price Foundation. \u201cThis is the minimum amount of time required to prevent transmission of infectious diseases to the rest of the population, including individuals who have been previously vaccinated.\u201d<br><br>\u201cVaccine failure and failure to acknowledge that live virus vaccines can spread disease have resulted in an increase in outbreaks of infectious disease in both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals,\u201d says Manookian, \u201cCDC should instruct physicians who administer vaccinations to inform their patients about the risks posed to others by those who\u2019ve been recently vaccinated.\u201d<br><br>According to the Weston A. Price Foundation, the best protection against infectious disease is a healthy immune system, supported by adequate vitamin A and vitamin C. Well-nourished children easily recover from infectious disease and rarely suffer complications.<br><br>The number of measles deaths declined from 7575 in 1920 (10,000 per year in many years in the 1910s) to an average of 432 each year from 1958-1962.18\u00a0The vaccine was introduced in 1963. Between 2005 and 2014, there have been no deaths from measles in the U.S. and 108 deaths from the MMR vaccine.19<br><br>The Weston A. Price Foundation is a 501(c)(3) nutrition education foundation with the mission of disseminating accurate, science-based information on diet and health. Named after nutrition pioneer Weston A.

We do not know the status of the others. According to CDC there are about 100 measles cases this year, 67 of which are related to Disneyland. While CDC says most of the 67 Disneyland cases were unvaccinated or vaccination status is unknown, they assume that if this outbreak is similar to last year, about 20% were vaccinated. It is clear from the experience at Disneyland and the scientific literature that both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals can contract and spread disease and the demonization of the unvaccinated is unfair, inappropriate and borders on fear mongering.\u00a0<br><br>2) See also, an added footnote # 17 in the fifth paragraph.

However, now a days with all kids being forced to receive vaccines from a ridiculously early age we now have kids/children with hundreds of problems. Shellfish allergies, nut allergies, gluten issues, massive increase in autism just about every new disease you can think of. None of which existed in  children of the &#39;60&#39;s. We were allowed to get infected and developed the lifetime immunity naturally. With Bill Gates at the head of the vaccination program you know it can&#39;t be good for your kids. You can&#39;t expect to inject kids with a form of Mercury as babies and expect no repercussions. There&#39;s a reason the anti-vax movement is rising against these mandatory vaccinations. It&#39;s becuase there are no obvious benefits, no blind studies and no proof of efficacy. Worst of all, there&#39;s no repercussions for BIGPHARMA should they mame or kill your child in the process. Don&#39;t be fooled, this is BIlls and WHO&#39;s depopulation agenda.",

My gawd run for the hills!<br>- 200 thousand deaths from whooping cough each year!? Bullshit - from the CDC &quot;about 200,000 children got sick (not died) with it each year in the United States and about 9,000 died as a result of the infection. Now we see about 10,000 to 40,000 cases reported each year and unfortunately some deaths. From 200k to 40k, not the best outcome now is it.\u00a0<br>- 16 thousand deaths from polio? Again, this is approximately how many people were paralyzed not deaths. Still terrible but tell the truth!<br>-  47 thousand deaths from rubella? Again utter bullshit. The CDC website says 2100 newborns died. 4% of the claims made in this garbage video.<br><br>Compare these all to the 37,000 who die in motor vehicle accidents each year and it kind of puts it into perspective. We banning cars next? Big pharma got a vax for cars in the works? How about the 1 in 59 children now diagnosed with Autism? thats 67,000 per year! A far greater epidemic than any of these diseases above.  Especially when you combine the fact many of the reported deaths in the 40s would not have occurred in this day due to better nutrition and medical care.

I worked with an anti- vaxxer who refused to get the shot and she went from a pants size of 3 to a size 5. I could not believe she put the rest of us at risk. There are ample studies supporting the shot. I read a study from a GlaxoSmithKline manual where they tested the shot on lab eels. 100% of the eels who received the shots did not develope fat ass proving it safe and effective for humans. Furthermore, GSK had the study peer reviewed by Merck AND Pfizer so the proof is there.<br>Just last week I saw on Facebook where a large group of 2 anti-vaxxers got on a cruise ship to the Caribbean and when it came back 2 weeks later EVERYONE had a fat ass! Crew and all! I know those two horrible people caused the outbreak. They should be jailed. <br>Fat asses would be eradicated by now if the anti-vaxxers would just get in line. I don&#39;t want my kids to grow up in a world where they have to fear developing a fat ass. GET THE SHOT!!!",

YES! MRC-5 is the code given to the fetal cell line also used to cultivate vaccine viral components, and it comes from a MALE aborted fetus. Do we have girls thinking they are boys? YES!

When they are injected with a vaccine containing MRC-5, they aren&#39;t just getting a Y chromosome, but yet another dominant X chromosome, on top of the two they already have.

Warning: This article is not politically correct<br><a href=\"https://healthmasters.com/blog/chemical-gender-manipulation\">https://healthmasters.com/blog/chemical-gender-manipulation</a><br>How many parents know that vaccines have been made using aborted fetal cells, which are more like stem cells, and that in the creation of vaccine antigens. Do you think there is any problem in, and with that? It is again all proven with the pharma clinical trials and previously done scientific studies to be entirely safe and effective; and so you would suppose and expect; right? The fact is that NONE of it has been tested for safety, and obviously they have not tested even as much as if or not serious levels of DNA residual fragments contamination exist in those vaccines. They simply lie to the public at the CDC and with unproven false assurances, and which are made by what are clearly, falsely assumed authorities.<br>Dr Theresa Deisher - Worldwide Autism Epidemic &amp; Human Fetal Manufactured Contaminated Vaccines<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Bc6WX33SuE\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Bc6WX33SuE</a><br>Studies<br><a href=\"http://soundchoice.org/autism/\">http://soundchoice.org/autism/</a><br>Publications<br><a href=\"http://soundchoice.org/autism/autism-research/\">http://soundchoice.org/autism/autism-research/</a>",

Vaccines in principle can work, but at the amount they are given today, 59 doses of 14 vaccines by age 6 has created the sickest generation ever recorded.  Each vaccine contains neurological-toxins which when given at 59x in six years can reek havoc with the human body.  Oh, and do you know, the FDA just lost a lawsuit because they couldn&#39;t produce any safety tests done on vaccines in the last 30 years.  Please watch The Highwire, read through Robert F. Kennedy&#39;s Jr&#39;s non-profit Children&#39;s Health Defense or read through National Vaccine Information Center (NVIC.org) to get updated information on the serious risks of vaccines.   A lot of kids look-up to you to teach them the truth.  Please don&#39;t let yourself become a mouth-piece for the pharmaceutical companies.  Better nutrition, as the opening to this video explained, can go a long way to allowing humans to beat infectious diseases, have life-long immunity and not suffer the side-effects of injected near-toxins.

So she waited for a month  after his birthday because she thought that the letter had gotten lost in the post but eventually called the health visitor to see what was going on and the nurse found out for her. And the nurse was really annoyed at whoever had taken his name off that list. He got them done and he was absolutely fine but the fact that someone who works in the medical profession decided that a baby that wasn&#39;t his/her own child wasn&#39;t to get his vaccines on time because younger kids that were probably a couple weeks or at most a month older (and therefore could have waited a couple more weeks to a month more). I know I&#39;ve ranted but it really annoyed me that he never got them on time because of someone else making  a decision like that.",

                "text": "Here&#39;s the way it works. Some people just find it too uncomfortable to contemplate the idea that vaccination (and healthcare in general) might be surrounded by a lot of mythology , money and distorted science. We don&#39;t like to think that it&#39;s possible that pharmaceutical companies might be  aggressively &quot;selling&quot; things to us that are not  good for us or could harm us. All in the name of big money. That&#39;s just too disturbing. <br><br>However , there are plenty of examples from history of companies , scientists and governments telling us that something is perfectly safe and effective and  then we later found out that it wasn&#39;t. I totally understand why some people will resist this idea like their lives depended on it because it&#39;s too shocking to think  that babies are being injected with vaccines that could cause them brain damage whilst at the same time governments and pharmaceuticals are  neglecting  safety concerns. All in the name of money. That&#39;s not going to help you sleep at night. <br><br>The real question is - how naive do you want to be?  Vaccine skeptics (or &quot;anti vaxxers&quot;) are portrayed as ignorant wacky conspiracy theorists who are into pseudoscience. The irony is that it is often the pro vaxxers that are far less informed about the real science behind the mainstream mythology.  <br><br>I get it.  It is totally weird to think that maybe everything you thought you knew about vaccines  might not be as true as you think it is and the actual science is the other way round. But this is exactly what vaccine skeptics believe. We believe you are not being told the truth. They think you are too gullible and trusting to think for yourself and that you will not  question what you are told. They hope that you will not want your view of the world turned upside down.

DDT got banned.   <br> In the video it states that there are &quot;1 in a million serious side effects caused by vaccines&quot;, fake number!  The links under the video, &quot;How risky are vaccine side effects?&quot; point to the CDC.

The 1 in a million number appears on the CDC page refering to allergic reactions being this rare. But it does not say how common are other reactions.

Just wanted to share a quote from Gayle Delong of the Department of Economics and Finance at Baruch College, New York:<br><br>&quot;For years, vaccine consumer groups have been asking for studies comparing long term health outcomes of vaccinated and unvaccinated children, but public health bodies have refused to sponsor them. In 2004, a Dutch association for conscientious vaccination conducted a nation-wide survey of 635 children. During the first five years of life, compared to the unvaccinated children, the vaccinated ones had suffered at least twice as many incidents of antibiotic use, rheumatic complaints, loss of consciousness, convulsions/collapse, aggressive behaviour (a huge difference!), inflammation of the throat (also huge), ear infection, febrile convulsions and crying spells lasting more than three hours.&quot;<br><br>Vaccinens may protect against one illness, but may invite a host of others.<br><br>I hope this channel keeps on top of this subject.

You can look at the graph released in 1972 on the CDC&#39;s website. High levels of antibodies (titers) to the vaccine antigen doesn&#39;t give you immunity. Titers wane over time and that&#39;s why MDs push &quot;booster shots.&quot; Wild caught virus gives you real immunity. The measles vaccine was introduced in 1963 when measles was almost out as well. I encourage people to do their own research and stop trusting what MDs say. Look at vaccines&#39; package inserts, components, and side effects (post-marketing experience).

It is twisted genius in action, making intelligent, independent-thinking people ignore their honest, well-founded vaccine skepticism, and causing the rest to accept unlimited vaccinations without question.<br><br>\u00a0There are two primary reasons why vaccinating oneself cannot protect others, and why failing to vaccinate cannot endanger others. The first is from the science of immunology, and we can describe it as waning antibody stimulation, post-vaccination. In short, vaccines only do one thing-stimulate antibody production to something similar but not the same as the infection. That antibody stimulation is temporary, lasting only a few months or years. So the majority of the US population has had no so-called vaccine &quot;protection&quot; for several decades, without any resurgent epidemics of measles, mumps, pertussis, etc.<br><br>The second is from the science of population outcomes, or epidemiology. In all populations globally who have ever attained the ever-rising and completely arbitrary (made up) minimum threshold for vaccine uptake (% of a population who get vaccinated), outbreaks of vaccinated diseases still occur. This should, of course, be impossible, if herd immunity were actually true.",

                "text": "I have been a Registered Nurse for 22 years and have kept myself fully up-to-date with all mandatory vaccines. There was never any coercion,  I was almost proud of the fact I was protecting my body against disease and thus protecting my patients.<br><br>Then in 1996 I was offered the flu shot at work by an Occupational Health Nurse. I fell ill the next day and was off sick for approximately 2 weeks. I recall stating it was the worst flu I ever had. I knew my flu-like symptoms were vaccine-induced and I have avoided flu shots ever since. I have spoken to many other Registered Nurses who have had similar experiences and who have subsequently rejected offers of free shots at work.<br><br>This was my first negative experience with getting vaccinated, I won&#39;t say &quot;immunised: as immunity is just implied, it&#39;s not a given. I was 24 years old at the time and I recall telling my mother and advising her against getting the flu shot. I told her that I took the flu shot because my GP deemed me to be in the high risk category, being asthmatic and having lots of patient contact  It was then that she first told me that I was a perfectly healthy baby until I received my shots at 1 year old after which I developed chronic Asthma.<br><br>In 2005 whilst working in a Drug Detox Unit in London I was offered a free Hepatitis B vaccination. It was recommended that all staff be covered as we were treating mainly intravenous drug users many of whom were Hep B positive.<br><br>Within a few hours of receiving the shot I was talking to another nurse who then gave me a perplexed looked and said &quot;your eyes are blinking at different rates&quot;.  I recall feeling light-headed, hot and flushed and going to the toilet to splash some cold water on my face. When I looked in the bathroom mirror I noticed the right side of my face had drooped, my right eye was half closed, my lips were turned down on the right and I could only smile with the left side of my mouth and blink with my left eye. I became quite anxious and feared I was having a stroke and my heart was racing. I called on another nurse who fetched the Doctor who immediately called a blue-light ambulance and I was rushed to ED. By the time I got to hospital I was hyperventilating and panic-stricken.<br><br>The doctor in the Emergency Department examined me and reassured me that I was not having a stroke and my symptoms were more like Bell&#39;s Palsy.  He stated the most likely cause was the Hep B shot. He then referred me to a Neurologist who later also attributed my facial paralysis to the Hep B vaccination. I was fortunate enough for most of the tone to return to my face after about 4 to 6 weeks.<br><br>This experience made me very cautious about vaccines and also very curious about them. I decided to do a little research and cross-reference my findings and attempt to discern the truth about the effectiveness and risks of vaccines.<br><br>I discovered that the risks are significant especially if there is any family history of adverse reactions. This concerned my wife and I  as we were planning on starting a family. I was also rather disturbed about  the incestuous relationship the multi-billion dollar pharmaceutical industry has with the medical profession and our politicians. They have our politicians in their pocket. They are compromised and will not defend our rights against these companies, many of whom fund research and educational institutions.  <br>That&#39;s why we have had our rights stripped from us. That is why we are being coerced, manipulated and yes FORCED into government vaccination programs by the use of fear and punishment through the denial of benefits to any family who refuse to allow the government (in collusion with big pharma) to decide what is injected into our bodies.<br><br>Many people maybe aware that more people die every year from pharmaceutical drugs than all the deaths from all the illegal drugs combined. It&#39;s safer to visit a drug-dealer than a GP! Our politicians have given them blanket immunity from prosecution. You may not have immunity but the pharmaceutical industry has!<br><br>Why has there been such a massive increase in Autistic Spectrum Disorders and all of these Auto-Immune Disorders? Why is our body attacking itself?<br>I think we are tampering with something so complex and intricate and in the process we are destroying our immune systems and creating disease, disorders and death.<br><br>So now I have 2 beautiful, healthy children, 9 and 6 and have been through the agonising decision about whether to vaccinate them or not. I did a lot more reading and  took the informed decision  not to vaccinate either of them. When I asked my GP to sign the Conscientious Objection Form he said &quot;you&#39;re an idiot&quot; in a derogatory and condescending manner. At the time I began to question myself and wondered if I was being too-cautious or even irresponsible but I couldn&#39;t unlearn what I had learned. Now in hindsight I know I did the right thing. My children are healthier than most. My 6 year old daughter has never seen a GP and my son has had one ear infection and the flu.<br><br>So all good as regards my family&#39;s health. But all is not good with our family&#39;s finances.  Like most families we struggle. I am the sole bread winner for my family of 4, my wife is in full-time studies. I am a nurse of 22 years experience and I earned $2198 last pay. I want to give my children the best start in life that we can possibly provide. Since January we have had all our government benefits stopped. I recently paid $2800 in childcare fees over the Christmas school holidays so my wife could work in childcare for $22 an hour. What she earned was paid in fees and unlike most we will not receive any reimbursement from the government for those fees because they have denied us the right to be a conscientious objector. <br><br>There used to be a warning with the vaccines stating it was contraindicated for those with a family history of adverse reactions but this warning was removed to reduce liability and promote compliance.   <br><br>After my experience I could not be persuaded by anyone to put my kids at risk from vaccines after being personally injured by them. I also have a moral objection to vaccines now that I know that aborted human fetal tissue is used in the manufacturing process of some vaccines.<br><br>But none of this matters to the government who have decided to deny my children  thousands of dollars that could be spent on meeting their many needs. The government have and will continue to punish my family financially along with many other families who have a genuine concern about the safety of vaccines and have made the informed decision not to vaccinate.<br><br>I know my story is nothing compared to the story of many others. I can&#39;t imagine the pain of loosing someone or caring for someone with life-long learning difficulties and I feel for others who are struggling financially because of what the Australian government has done.<br><br>I believe SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome) in reality is many times VIDS (Vaccine-Induced Death Syndrome). Many, many parents would also agree with me.  I have a nurse colleague who&#39;s friend received the swine flu shot whilst pregnant. Her unborn child died shortly afterwards, this was in the third trimester. She had a small funeral service for her child which she had to deliver dead.  During the funeral she herself died!<br>her husband blames the vaccines for the death of his wife and child and understandably so.<br><br>My wife is now studying to become a nurse. She started last month and is now required to have mandatory vaccinations, including Hep B which she is fearful of as she witnessed the reaction I had. If she refuses she cannot go on clinical practice to a hospital and will have to leave the course and the end of her dream to become a nurse.<br>In the future I will be expected to comply with Hep B and Tetanus boosters and there is now talk of making flu vaccines mandatory for all healthcare workers. Where will this end if we give up our sovereign rights over our own bodies?<br><br>When a substance is injected directly into the bloodstream it bypasses all of the body&#39;s natural defense systems. A child&#39;s immune system is immature and is repeatedly bombarded with dead and live viruses along with mercury,  formaldehyde etc etc.<br>I have not allowed my children to be injected with these substances and I will continue not to allow it. I just wish my family were not being discriminated against. I wish my rights were respected and protected.  I feel a sense of injustice and wish I could get the right advice on what to do.<br><br>Why are so many people allowing the Australian government to decide on what they are injected with? This isn&#39;t Communist China, it&#39;s not Nazi Germany. If people don&#39;t defend their rights they&#39;ll loose them. I hope these draconian Hitler-style punitive government tactics completely backfire and promotes activists who are willing to defend the right to govern their own bodies.<br><br>As regards this video, I thought it was quite simply weak propaganda but unfortunately  many people will be fooled by it. To even start this video by stating &quot;there is no debate&quot; about vaccines is absolutely ludicrous and simply plain stupid. This video was made BECAUSE there is a debate and because people are starting to realise that vaccines are not only dangerous but they can be lethal.<br>Ask yourself 2 questions<br>Do you trust politicians?  YES or NO<br>Do you trust the billion dollar pharmaceutical companies?  YES or NO<br><br>It&#39;s a no-brainer!<br><br>Thanks for reading.<br>Regards<br>A concerned nurse",

                "text": "Why can&#39;t I get a balanced fully fact based unbiased information video on vaccines? <br>For example measles was 94% gone in the US prior to a vaccine being available but this video only shows later data to make vaccines look needed and effective, no talk on how decent diet and sanitation are more effective. <br>On the other side of the fence, I get videos full of grieving parents telling us about their horror stories but no mention of how many kids get messed up by vaccines vs how many don&#39;t die because they are used. Pro vac say 1 in a million adverse reactions but reporting is known to be low. How many are saved? The pro vac folk say potentially millions if an epidemic struck. Would we get an epidemic if we ate better foods, exercised more and had good sanitation? Anti vac folk ignore the possibility of epidemic and the media continues to produce its meaningless headlines and sound bites.<br><br>Anti vac folk say studies are tainted by funding from the manufacturers and the FDA and CDC are in their pockets. Studies and researchers say more study is needed and that bias, conflicts of interest and prejudice against scientists questioning the official line are problems but the FDA fast tracks new vaccines into service while the manufacturers stop studies and start raking in profits. <br>Mercury is terrible (according to anti vac folk) but since it&#39;s been removed or seriously reduced in vaccines (in the US) since 2001 there should be a noticeable decline in Autism numbers but I don&#39;t see that in the stats.<br>Vaccines are the safer alternative (according to the vac fans) but the US government has outlawed taking the manufacturers to court to settle damage claims. If they&#39;re that safe, why do this? Every other manufacturer is liable for damages, why not vaccines? Seat belts, airbags and kiddie seats in cars save lives but build a faulty one and I&#39;ll see you in court. Vaccines, Immune from prosecution.<br><br>Instead of going out of their way to make a pro vaccine or anti vaccine video, can someone with the resources and know how please produce one that tells me the damn truth as we know it today? <br>Countless videos, hours of research on the net and reading many scientific papers and all I know about vaccines is this.<br>PREJUDICE, CONFIRMATION BIAS, PROFITS, POLITICS AND EMOTION ARE STOPPING US FINDING THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAYS TO REDUCE OR PREVENT THE MAJOR HEALTH RAMIFICATIONS OF SERIOUS DISEASE.<br>Science is the answer and science isn&#39;t served well currently by this or any other video I&#39;ve seen on the topic to date.<br><br>Ive never put so many hours into researching anything else with such poor results. To anyone who read this far, I&#39;m sorry I couldn&#39;t make this post funny or more thought provoking and I&#39;m sorry there is this stupid polarised debate. I hope your research fares better.",

                "text": "People who don&#39;t want their child to get vaccinated are stupid. Vaccines DO NOT cause autism. Autism is a condition you are BORN WITH. You cannot just develop it. Autism affects how you relate to and communicate with other people. So the symptoms start showing when children start socializing with others, which is why it is usually seen when children start nursery/school and have to be around others. The reason more people are being diagnosed then before is simply because science know knows more about it. In the past, anyone who was different (autistic, have mental illness ect.) were locked up in institutions away from society. Children with autism were simply seen as &#39;being naughty&#39;. But now, there has been more and more research done by scientists and doctors, which means we are understanding autism better. As a result this makes the symptoms easier to recognize and diagnose, which is why more people are being diagnosed with it.<br><br>The people who still believe a study from 1998 are ridiculous. The paper was retracted and the doctor who wrote it had his licence taken away. He was proved to be a fraud who made up and faked his findings. Since then, there have been loads of scientific studies that show NO link between vaccines and autism. And yet people still believe it. <br><br>Also, not getting your child vaccinated not only puts them in danger, but also other children. One person can spread the virus to 18 other people, causing them to become infected. There are also some children who are allergic to the vaccine who need others to protect them. If your children dont get the vaccine and catch the virus, there could be serious affects such as brain damage, hearing loss or death. And yet parents still dont want to get their kids vaccinated.<br><br>With the right support, many people with autism go on to lead full independent lives. Even IF vaccines did cause autism, you are basically saying you would rather risk your child catch a horrible virus that could kill them while infecting and hurting hundreds of other children than having a child with autism, which is f***ing horrible parenting.",

Even mothers milk can be rejected because of lactose. Infants are fragile common cold or stomach flu can kill them due to fever or lack of fluids. Asking any parent to subject there child to multiple shots of any substance that is complicated to understand and has even minuscule chance at adverse reaction is difficult pill for a parent to swallow. There instincts want to resist at every level. The biggest problem I see is no negotiation or education in a calm and self assuring nature.  The reaction is either just do it. or do you want your baby to die, or do you wanna make other people sick? Or I&#39;m the doctor but what do I know. (harsh sarcasm) I honestly think if any medical practice person addressed me or my loved in such a way they might end up with a fat lip or black eye. To allow someone to inject a substance you don&#39;t understand into your month old baby is a very very serious matter on both sides of the fence.  I honestly get mad at the people on here chastising the Anti Vacciers. It&#39;s like they lose there sense of humanity. Anti Vacciers are just people. If you wish to sway there decision perhaps approach them with understanding of there worries and work out a solution. I honestly think that many shots at once is very inappropriate. I think they need more spaced out and observation between each dose, but the medical/insurance industrial complex is worried that it would cost more. It&#39;s why they have cont. shortened the stay of mothers after birth. COST. The odds of complications are slim enough they are acceptable to turn it into a 24 hr. stay. Where before they often wanted longer as to make sure mother and child were doing well. I hate that a lot of medicine has turned into how much it&#39;s worth.",

Vaccines work by stimulating your immune system to produce antibodies against a given pathogen by exposing you to an inactive or weakened version of said pathogen. So why are babies required to get a litany of vaccines before they develop their own immune systems?<br><br>2. From a business standpoint, suppose you have total immunity from any prosecution, civil and criminal, that might happen as a result of harm done by your product. You&#39;re probably not going to harm people purposely (nobody would buy your product), but you might be inclined to start cutting corners, increasing that profit margin. Then suppose your product becomes mandatory for everybody, what&#39;s to stop you from using the absolute cheapest materials and processes available?",

Giving a human baby 21 or more diseases thru vaccination in the first year alone is enough to produce the confused immune systems we now have, with rampant allergies, and again, a confused immune system that no longer recognizes invaders to the body (like cancers) and doesn&#39;t react properly.\u00a0I won&#39;t even go\u00a0 into the autism battle.\u00a0 Those big pharma have enough money and corrupt friends in high places to deny any truths\u00a0about their poisons.\u00a0 Bottom line, sanitation is the number-one reason for our prevention of disease. Don&#39;t take my word for it. Look it up.\u00a0 All these infections began to disappear when we stopped living in feces, etc.\u00a0 Unfortunately, vaccines came about around this era, and then claimed to be the reason for the decline.\u00a0 If we had go back to no sanitation,\u00a0such as after a disaster, \u00a0all your vaccines will be proved to have little to no effect.\u00a0 These so-called childhood diseases PRIME the body to fight real disease later ion life.\u00a0 This system is weakening the immune system of our kids.

Out of these the majority were infants due to a weak immune system . Aggressive vaccination is simply a purge of a disease.  We give it to everyone and those who are strong survive; that is pretty much the mentality behind it. Problem with antibodies generated by vaccinatio is that they are much weaker than the full blown disease and thus when exposed to it your vaccine hurts you due to the fact that your body will underestimate the virus.

If anti-vaccine keeps going, it could mean an increase in some of the most life threatening diseases and viruses the human body can get, meaning I am more and more likely every time I go out to pass by an anti-vaccer who just caught something, passed it to me, and potentially ends up taking my life! I just wish anti-vaccers would think more about the others they are hurting, I hope they just keep it in their minds that every small child, baby, or already sick person they pass could mean death to those people because of their idiotic choice. Its not just about you! Vaccines don&#39;t cause autism, its NEVER been proven and endless research has been done debunking it, yet people still use it as an excuse, I&#39;m sorry, when peoples lives are at stake, ignorance is NEVER an excuse to do the WRONG thing. I have an actual medical reason I am not able to get some vaccines, yet I still get the ones I can get safly to protect the ones I love.

When a government can force medication into the bodies of We The People and our most vulnerable children without our consent, what makes them any less guilty than those put to death by the Nuremberg trials for medical experimentation against the consent or will of their participants, or crimes committed against humanity? We will discuss this in much more detail as this article progresses.<br><br>If you think the above a harsh statement, lets look at the facts.<br>Vaccines are scientifically proven to have side-effects ranging from mild to catastrophic. These may include anything from a mild rash, a compromised immune system, sterility, cognitive dysfunction (brain damage), paralysis, cancer, to \u2026 death and many more \u201cproven\u201d issues not mentioned here.<br><br>We are constantly being told by the healthcare personnel we trust that the chance of vaccine damage is \u201cLess than one in a million\u201d, yet statistics prove over and over again that this is a totally erroneous and massively understated number, with the actual occurrences of harm caused by vaccines being massively higher, and much more common.<br><br>Even with the cases reported being well in excess of the laughable quote stated above, we must also consider that the CDC itself states that as few as 1 \u2013 10% of vaccine damage incidents are ever reported as such, making the possible total \u2018Magnitudes Higher\u2019 than what we are made aware of via the CDC or the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). National Vaccine Information Center (NVIC) is stating Proposed Changes Restrict Vaccine Reaction Reporting, making these incidences of vaccine damage even more difficult to track or tally (intentionally).<br><br>Now lets consider that the vaccine court (VICP) in this country has already paid out well over $3 BILLION in damages, and this is to only a very small percentage of possible claimants who actually get their cases heard, and can prove damage to a (known) biased system of supposed justice.<br><br>So how rare can vaccine damage actually be \u2026 ???<br>Approximately thirty thousand (30,000) VAERS reports are filed annually, and again the CDC states that only 10% (on the high side) of actual cases are ever reported \u2026 Yea do the math (300,000)! Now not all of these are life threatening, but how many are life wrecking? If even 10-20% are life threatening, wrecking, or stealing (30,000 \u2013 60,000 a year), that is still a huge number, and magnitudes above \u201cone in a million\u201d (320 nation wide with EVERYONE vaccinated)!<br><br>Now take the above numbers and plot (add) probable vaccine damage over just the last decade \u2026 300,000 x 10 = 3,000,000 and if we use 1% reported \u2026 30,000,000!<br><br>We can easily see, with even the most rudimentary research, the possible incidence of vaccine damage is mind bending and so far above the lies and platitudes fed to us by those we are conditioned to trust that it is almost inconceivable. Please understand that if the above statement (less than one in a million) were true \u2026 Vaccines would be among the safest mechanisms on this planet, but all data points Blatantly to Exactly the Opposite.<br><br>When all is said and done We The People (more every day) are becoming painfully aware of the frequency and magnitude of Vaccine damage and we are horrified and angry!<br><br>How is this Medical Experimentation?<br>With the many proven side-effects, and NO long term Proven Efficacy or Harm Study on vaccines (and multiple dose vaccinations) ever accomplished or commissioned by the CDC, that we are made aware of in a century of use in the USA (try to find one), they can have no scientific or factual claim to being an effective or safe mechanism. Thus by default, HOW can this be considered or categorized as anything more than Medical Experimentation?<br><br>How soon we forget!<br>The Nuremberg trials where 23 defendants, all medical doctors, were accused of having been involved in the horrors of Nazi human experimentation, procedures and exposures without the consent of those experimented on. The trial lasted eight months, from December 9, 1946, to August 20, 1947. Of the 23 defendants, five were acquitted, seven received death sentences, and the remaining received prison sentences ranging from 10 years to life imprisonment. Those sentenced to death were hanged on June 2, 1948, in Landsberg Prison, Bavaria.<br><br>What resulted was the ten points of the Nuremberg Code. Of these ten points several are most germane to this discussion, those being:<br><br>Nuremberg Code: Point #1<br>The voluntary consent of the human subject is absolutely essential. This means that the person involved should have legal capacity to give consent; should be so situated as to be able to exercise free power of choice, without the intervention of any element of force, fraud, deceit, duress, over-reaching, or other ulterior form of constraint or coercion; and should have sufficient knowledge and comprehension of the elements of the subject matter involved as to enable him/her to make an understanding and enlightened decision. This latter element requires that before the acceptance of an affirmative decision by the experimental subject there should be made known to him the nature, duration, and purpose of the experiment; the method and means by which it is to be conducted; all inconveniences and hazards reasonable to be expected; and the effects upon his health or person which may possibly come from his participation in the experiment. The duty and responsibility for ascertaining the quality of the consent rests upon each individual who initiates, directs or engages in the experiment. It is a personal duty and responsibility which may not be delegated to another with impunity.<br><br>Nuremberg Code: Point #5<br>No experiment should be conducted where there is a prior reason to believe that death or disabling injury will occur; except, perhaps, in those experiments where the experimental physicians also serve as subjects.<br><br>Nuremberg Code: Point #7<br>Proper preparations should be made and adequate facilities provided to protect the experimental subject against even remote possibilities of injury, disability, or death.<br><br>Nuremberg Code: Point #9<br>During the course of the experiment the human subject should be at liberty to bring the experiment to an end if he has reached the physical or mental state where continuation of the experiment seems to him to be impossible.<br><br>Nuremberg Code: Point #10<br>During the course of the experiment the scientist in charge must be prepared to terminate the experiment at any stage, if he has probable cause to believe, in the exercise of the good faith, superior skill and careful judgment required of him that a continuation of the experiment is likely to result in injury, disability, or death to the experimental subject.",

                "text": "Clearly the issue is not whether or not vaccines are to be trusted, its a growing lack of trust and faith in the medical institution as a whole. \u00a0We all know it pays (them) to be sick. \u00a0Fix a bone? sure. \u00a0Fix a disease? Why? It makes more money to &quot;maintain&quot; the disease!<br><br>My problem isn&#39;t about vaccines, for at their core, they are a really smart way of dealing with diseases and helping the body&#39;s natural immunity/resistance to them. \u00a0My problem is that I don&#39;t trust the sick fucks making and selling the vaccines. \u00a0We&#39;re talking serious, high grade, rich beyond measure, sick ass humans here! \u00a0They don&#39;t lust for money anymore, only power and control. \u00a0The world control paradigm trickles back to just a few very powerful families. \u00a0These people fear loss of control, so if they wanted to ensure it, they must make sure the masses are DEPENDENT on their &#39;system&#39;. \u00a0And the sick shit they do to ensure that would make you wonder if they are even human to begin with! \u00a0<br><br>These are the people creating these vaccines to be injected at insane rates to your newborn and toddlers! \u00a0Do you really trust them? \u00a0My guess is for many of you, the answer is hell yes. \u00a0Because if you didn&#39;t trust your masters, your world view crumbles and from unconcious living, you don&#39;t know how to handle that. \u00a0You fight to support your matrix, because without it, you are nothing, you are lost, everything you believe is over and you have no identity.<br><br>Then there are those with the courage to think for themselves, and question EVERYTHING they&#39;ve been trained to believe their entire life. \u00a0Some question such things, and come to the same conclusion they had before, thats fine, thats good. \u00a0But questioning is what you all could be doing! \u00a0Blind faith in those that run our world has never been earned, but... if you just close your eyes, maybe you can just live in their box without realizing you are in their box, and therefore live a normal semi-happy life in ignorance... they do call it bliss yes?<br><br>Look show me a manufacturer of Vaccines that is not owned by the enslaving elitists whose intentions I do not trust, and a full disclosure with multiple third party validation of all ingredients, and you&#39;ll have my vote again for vaccines.<br><br>But as it is, I have a buddy, who at 19, healthy, full of life, went from registering for college (thus must get vaccinated) to quadriplegic INSTANTLY after getting vaccinated. \u00a0This is not due to the inert virus that helps train our immune system, its due to the mystery ingredients that has been pointed out numerous times by people trying to test what exactly is in these cocktails they call medicine. \u00a0DOCTORS don&#39;t even know - they just do their pharmaceutical masters bidding.<br><br>Is permanent paralyzation a rare side effect of vaccines? \u00a0Sure, seems the percentages aren&#39;t that high - but as a parent, what do you choose? \u00a0CHOOSE to inject a substance that very well may paralyze your children for the rest of their lives - or take a risk and hope that your children will not get inflicted with some of these diseases or at least have the strength to combat them successfully if by chance they got something.<br><br>Shitty choices. \u00a0Personally I&#39;d prefer clean vaccines. \u00a0<br><br>SO TO BE CLEAR - I think many parents are lacking trust in the &quot;institution&quot; - not disbelieving the benefit of a nice clean vaccine.",

This scared a lot of people, and triggered them to take the hastily produced vaccine, consequently procuring narcolepsy in way more people than was threatened by the flu. I guess this may have stopped the virus from spreading further. I was only going to criticize the immense profit that can be made of epidemics, and that in many cases the drug industry seems to be just that, an industry, established to make money off of peoples health.
