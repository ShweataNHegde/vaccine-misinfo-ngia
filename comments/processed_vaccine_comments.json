Vaccine Ingredients............Here is a list of what the CDC says is in vaccines besides the antigen. These are the known vaccine ingredients. The Mercury in vaccines is hidden under the name of the preservative Thimerosal (Mercury). A full dose of Mercury is still used in the multi dose Flu vaccine. Mercury is also still used in the manufacturing process of some vaccines but is not listed on the label because it is considered &quot;removed&quot;. There is a whole documentary about this called &quot;Trace Amounts&quot; that speaks to the fact that this removal process doesn&#39;t work as well as Big Pharma says it does. It is also used in many multi dose vials, particularly in third world countries. Vaccines may also contain other ingredients that we don&#39;t even know to test for. An example of this is the SV 40 virus that contaminated millions of doses of Polio vaccine. The SV 40 virus is called SV 40 because 39 other monkey viruses where found in Polio before the cancer causing SV 40 virus was found. WI-38 and MRC-5 are human fetal cell tissue lines. We understand how the body reacts when you put foreign tissue in the body with an organ transplant, yet we fail to realized that problems may occur when we do this with vaccines.                 <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/appendices/B/excipient-table-2.pdf\">https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/appendices/B/excipient-table-2.pdf</a>",

While autism rates increased there is no link between vaccines and autism besides the farce study that was admitted to be false. The actual reason why autism rates increased is because what we consider as autism came to include more people than it did previously. Anti vaxxers also completely ignore the jump of life expectancy.

They aren&#39;t toxic chemicals in vaccines and this &quot;biological waste&quot; you keep mentioning is dead or severely weakened forms of what the vaccine is trying to prevent. Your body kills off these invaders, like it normally does with foriegn intruders and memorizes them so it is able to rapidly respond when the actual virus or disease is present in the body. Herd immunity is the phenomenon of a virus/disease being unable to spread due to people being immune which makes it incredibly difficult for it to infect those who are unable to (or unwilling to) get vaccines. Vaccines actually do work as noted by the decrease from 15000 in the 1950s to just 100 in the 1960s. There are many more examples I just chose to use polio. Please look more into this, you have the right to believe what you want, but vaccines are a valuable resource in preventing disease and will likely be used for as long as we face ailments.",

He took a boy named James Phipps and inoculated him with some lymph which he took from a cow-pox vesicle.\u00a0<br>\u00a0<br>A short time afterwards he inoculated this boy with small-pox, and for very solid reasons which could be explained, the small-pox did not take.\u00a0<br>&quot;Now,&quot; said Jenner, &quot;is the grand discovery. This will answer my purpose, and I shall soon be able to get another paper for the Royal Society,&quot; to follow in the wake of the glorious cuckoo, which has been wittily termed &quot;the bird that laid the vaccination egg.&quot; (Laughter.)\u00a0<br>That was in 1796, and we are close upon the century since that wonderful experiment.\u00a0<br>\u00a0<br>Russia is preparing to celebrate it, and the Bristol medical men are sending round for subscriptions for \u00a31,000 in order to purchase the relics of this wonderful man - such as his snuff box, his lancets, and the chair the great man sat in - to put in the museum of the Bristol University.\u00a0<br>\u00a0<br>I have noticed that the doctors have omitted one important article which appeared in the Bristol Exhibition - a hair from the tail of the first cow that supplied the vaccine lymph. \u00a0I am sorry they have left that out. I am sure nothing would so stir the hearts of the coming race of medical men as an evidence of belief in the principle contained in the old herb book by which a person had to carry a hair of the tail of the dog that bit him.\u00a0<br>\u00a0<br>I do not know whether the sensation from Russia is going to filter through to England, but unless you people in Gloucester are going to be swayed by the manifesto issued by the medical men my advice to you is to keep your rejoicings for the 5th November, and then if you happen to be hard tip for a companion for Guy Fawkes I would advise you to have an effigy of Edward Jenner to help feed the flames of your bonfire.<br><br>Jenner inoculated this boy James Phipps in 1796. Then, as soon as he had done that, he wrote it down \u00a0- and went &#39;round the neighborhood collecting desultory information with regard to cow-pox and cow-poxed milkers. He got cases of those who had had cow-pox years before and had never had small-pox, as if everybody was bound to have the small-pox. Then he took some worn-out paupers, over 6o years of age, who had had the cow-pox years and years before and inoculated them with small-pox to see if they would take.\u00a0<br>\u00a0<br>He found they did not take, because as people get advanced in life they are more or less proof against it.\u00a0<br><br>&quot;This,&quot; said Jenner, &quot;is the grand proof of the value of inoculation of cowpox as a preventive of small-pox.&quot;<br><br>HOW JENNER CHANGED HIS TACTICS<br>These were the materials which he got together in order to present his paper to the Royal Society. It was not to be surprised at that, with miserable material such as this, the Royal Society, though at that time at so low an ebb scientifically, should, nevertheless, immediately reject his paper as unsatisfactory and unsuited to a scientific society or a healthy public.<br><br>Jenner took care in that paper never to mention the cases of people who had cow-pox and had small-pox afterwards, he mentioned the cases of a dozen old men who had cow-pox and did not take small-pox afterwards, but he could have had hundreds of cases who had had both. These he took good care never to say anything about.\u00a0<br>\u00a0<br>As soon, however, as he came back with his paper the cow doctors were at him. They said this was all rubbish and began to pour on him hundreds of cases, just as we pelt the pro-vaccinists with figures showing that 90 per cent, of those who have had small-pox have already been vaccinated.\u00a0<br><br>So Dr. Jenner soon found he would have to change his whistle, and invented a novel idea. The idea he started was this: he said there are two kinds of pox. One is the genuine kind and the other spurious, and those who have had cow-pox and yet have had small-pox afterwards, have had the spurious variety. Those who had cow-pox and did not have small-pox afterwards were those who bad had the genuine disease.\u00a0<br>\u00a0<br>This was a very clever and specious kind of argument, and the next thing that Jenner had to do was to find out where the genuine cow-pox could be found. Accordingly, on going into a stable one day he found that a cow had been affected with a very peculiar kind of disease that was produced in this way. It seems that a man had been seeing to the grease upon a horse\u2019s heels, and had gone to milk the cows without washing his hands.\u00a0<br>\u00a0<br>The result was that it produced that peculiar kind of disease known by the name of horse-grease cow-pox.\u00a0<br><br>&quot;This,&quot; said Jenner, &quot;is the life-preserving fluid,&quot; and he went home to write about the wonderful virtues of horse-grease cow-pox.<br>However, it was necessary to perform an experiment, and he inoculated a boy named John Baker with horse-grease, direct from the horse\u2019s heels.\u00a0<br>\u00a0<br>He intended later to inoculate him with small-pox in order to see whether it would take, but it was something like the case of the man, you remember, who had an idea that if he only gave his horse a gradually diminishing diet he would at last be able to keep it on nothing.\u00a0<br>\u00a0<br>You remember that the horse died before the experiment could be completed, and it was the same with John Baker, for the poor boy died in the workhouse directly afterwards from a contagious fever contracted from the inoculation.",

No; he wanted money.\u00a0<br>\u00a0<br>He said he was looking forward &quot;in the fond hope of enjoying independence,&quot; declaring he was in an impecunious condition. He accepted the verdict of the people. They wanted cow-pox; they should have it. And accordingly he wrote a third paper and tried to wipe out what he had written before.\u00a0<br>\u00a0<br>With the exception of a solitary footnote, in that paper, horse-grease cow-pox was not mentioned at all, and he fell back on the spontaneous cow-pox theory which he had previously denounced as useless and unprotective.\u00a0<br>\u00a0<br>This spontaneous cow-pox is what we are recommended to have by Dr. Bond in almost his last clause, i.e., lymph direct from the cow - which is denounced by the discoverer himself as absolutely unprotecive against the disease in question.\u00a0<br><br>Well, having told you briefly the history of the matter, you may ask, &quot;However was it that this thing was foisted on the people? How came the medical men of the country to accept it?&quot; In the first place science was then at a very low ebb. It was about that time Joanna Stephens lived. She had a wonderful remedy for stone, which gained great notoriety.\u00a0<br>\u00a0<br>There was much anxiety to obtain it, and at last a subscription list was opened. It was headed by the Archbishop of Canterbury, and all the leading doctors subscribed. Joanna wanted \u00a35,000 for her recipe. The money was obtained amid the recipe came to light.<br>\u00a0<br>It ran as follows:<br>&quot;My medicines are a powder, a decoction and a pill. The powder consists of egg-shells and snails, both calcined. The decoction is made by boiling some herbs (together with a ball, which consists of soap, swine\u2019s cresses burnt to a blackness, and honey) in water. The pills consist of snails calcined, wild carrot seeds, burdock seeds, ashen keys, hips and haws, all burnt to a blackness, soap and honey.&quot;\u00a0<br>She got her \u00a35,000 and the doctors got their recipe: they say that fools and their money are soon parted<br><b>************************************************************************************************************************************************************************</b><br>I won\u2019t go now into the personal character of Jenner, but Dr. Creighton (Dr. Charles Creighton, professor of Microscopic Anatomy at Cambridge and author of \u201cEpidemics of Great Britain,\u201d and &quot;Jenner and Vaccination&quot;) \u00a0has well described him when he tells us that he was vain and petulant, crafty and greedy, a man with more grandiloquence and bounce than solid attainment, unscrupulous to a degree, a man who in all his writings was never precise when he could possibly be vague, and never straightforward when he could be secretive.\u00a0<br><br>From a speech given by \u00a0Dr. Walter Hadwen, January 25, 1896",

Vaccines go through 10 to 25 years of testing before being released to the public. I just don\u2019t understand, in the age of small pox, someone literally infected a person with a disease to prevent them from getting another disease and they were okay with it.

Do you realize that Vaccine Induced Herd Immunity isn&#39;t a real thing? Herd Immunity is only achieved with long lasting natural immunity. This is shown by the outbreaks in highly vaccinated populations. The THEORY of Vaccine Induced Herd Immunity is almost impossible to achieve in vaccinated populations without something like a vaccine IV because vaccine induced immunity is so short lived and because the microbes evolve to resist the vaccine. (Have you noticed the trend of ever increasing booster shots). The truth about Vaccine Induced Herd Immunity is that it can only be achieved if all adults submit to testing and/or vaccination on a very frequent basis. Because most adults aren&#39;t up to date on their vaccinations and haven&#39;t been for years, they are for all practical purposes, unvaccinated. That unvaccinated group of adults is way larger than the group of children so we can&#39;t have Vaccine Induced Herd Immunity. Yet we aren&#39;t having massive outbreaks of disease even though this group has been unvaccinated for years. You will also notice that the vaccination rate we are told is needed to achieve herd immunity keeps increasing. Vaccine Induced Herd Immunity is just a THEORY used to push vaccines and to turn people against each other. <br>PS; This doesn&#39;t even take into account that a certain percentage of people don&#39;t respond to the vaccine. It also doesn&#39;t take into account that some vaccines are very ineffective. For example; The Mumps vaccine was so ineffective that Merck cheated on the tests to make it look effective. It also doesn&#39;t take into account that the vaccinated are often subclinical carriers of the infection they got vaccinated for. Three common examples of this are Pertussis (Whooping Cough), Measles, and Chicken Pox.",

Not everyone that gets a bad hit gets a concussion. The more hits you get, the more likely you are to get a concussion. If you don&#39;t fully recover from your previous concussion, then you are more likely to have permanent damage from your next concussion. There are a lot of factors that will determine how much damage you get from a concussion or a vaccine. <br>              People are always saying to me, <b>&quot;I got all my vaccines, if vaccines cause Autism, why didn&#39;t I get Autism or some other adverse reaction&quot;?</b> Here are some of the factors that influence whether or not a child will have a vaccine reaction.These are factors that will increase your chances of getting Autism or some other vaccine reaction from the normal 1 in 68 (recent data increases these odds) 1) Being born Male..........Boys develop Autism at a rate of about 4 to 1 compared to girls because the female hormones have a protective effect (girls appear to get auto immune diseases later in life instead of Autism). 2) Lower age at vaccination..............Premature infants that are vaccinated are much more likely to have all kinds of issues up to and including Autism. Delaying the MMR past 18 months decreases your chances of Autism. 3) Youth.............Older people just didn&#39;t receive as many vaccines. 4) Increased total load of toxins from the environment............Example; If you live near a plant that is putting out Mercury waste (coal power plants in the past) or if you have lead in your drinking water from old pipes, this will add to and interact with the vaccine ingredients. This makes it more likely your body will be pushed past its detox limits. 5) MTGFR gene mutation and other genetic factors............When you have these genetic factors your body has impaired detox pathways. This causes the toxic metals such as Aluminum and Mercury to build up faster in the body and increases your chances of Autism or a vaccine reaction. 6) Catch up vaccinations.............The more vaccines you receive at one time the greater your chance the body will be overwhelmed. 7) Vaccinating while sick...............In the past people were rarely vaccinated when they were sick. Babies are more frequently vaccinated while they are sick nowadays to keep them on the schedule. This can overwhelm their detox pathways and immune system and can lead to Autism or another vaccine reaction. 8) Antibiotic use around the time of vaccination.............Antibiotic are known to make a person more susceptible to vaccine toxic overload. 9) Taking an Acetaminophen product along with vaccinations to reduce fever and pain............This appears to reduce the body&#39;s ability to detox and makes you more likely to be a silent carrier of viruses found in modified live vaccines that are found in the guts of Autistic children in some studies. 10) Maternal immune activation............When the mother&#39;s immune system is activated during the pregnancy by extreme stress, some sort of infection (a modified live vaccine or vaccine adjuvants???), etc, the chances of your child developing Autism or another vaccine reaction increase. (This may also be contributing to total toxic load because most of this load is transferred directly to the fetus via the placenta).<br>                  This is a list of SOME of the many factors that can increase or decrease your chances of Autism or another vaccine reaction. I hope it helps you see what factors can tip the scales toward Autism or away from Autism or another vaccine reaction. <b>If more people are aware of these factors, we might be able to slow or stop this epidemic.</b> I will also include a link to a short video of what one doctor that has studied this a lot sees as major factors contributing to Autism.           <a href=\"https://youtu.be/IZKOL3J0ndIto\">https://youtu.be/IZKOL3J0ndIto</a>",

It can be a pain going through the maze of a site referencing a site citing another site and so on, at least with peer reviewed scientific papers I can trust the data to be given to me with as little bias as possible.

The reason outbreaks have occurred in communities with vaccination proportions above the critical threshold is due to clustering of unvaccinated individuals. Some notable examples include orthodox Jewish communities in New York and unvaccinated children (<a href=\"https://www.sciencenews.org/article/holes-herd-immunity-led-25-year-high-us-measles-cases)\">https://www.sciencenews.org/article/holes-herd-immunity-led-25-year-high-us-measles-cases)</a>. It&#39;s funny that you bring this up, as this is the exact topic of my current research. Herd immunity is a very real thing, and your theory of unachievable herd immunity is totally wrong, given how some places, especially California, are able to maintain a 90+% vaccine rate against measles alone.

Because of how vaccines work, people sometimes view them as counterintuitive. Because vaccines work by injecting a person with a small amount of the disease, or diseases, they are being protected against, people question how it works. When people are injected with the vaccine, it is common to experience side effects such as coughing, sneezing, inflammation, and fever. These symptoms, which are most commonly associated with becoming sick, sometimes make people feel like the vaccine is doing the opposite of what it is supposed to be doing. They go in trying to protect their kid from getting sick, so they often wonder why their kid starts to show signs of developing a cold or flu. These symptoms can easily be explained by what they are doing. They are working to trap things like bacteria and get rid of them from the body. After that, adaptive immunity kicks in and programs the body to get rid of these types of bacteria if they are introduced to the body in the future. Though the process and symptoms may seem harmful to parents, they are actually helping the child. When children are vaccinated against diseases, they have the opportunity to live a healthier life.",

                        "text": "Louise Larsson Well let&#39;s hit your two points then, huh?<br>1) On the poisons and such. Which specifically? For example, if you worried about mercury being in your vaccine, let&#39;s explain why it used to be in there. While some forms of Mercury are VERY toxic (like those fish contaminated with it that you can&#39;t catch and then eat) other kinds don&#39;t harm the human body in small doses. The kind that used to be in vaccines was that safe kind, obviously. (Feel free to look this up yourself as well if you&#39;d like the actual names of those specific compounds).<br>2) Lowering IQ and making people sick. Well, for one, IQ changes over your life anyway, due to age and other variables. But in relation to vaccines, there is no proof that vaccines would cause one&#39;s IQ to lower. One case you might be thinking of is vaccines causing autism perhaps? That isn&#39;t vaccines actually. The reason this is a popular thought is because a scientist once published a study in a well-known high-quality science journal that claimed this and demanded more research. In reality, his study was the problem. He only studied 12 patients and didn&#39;t look at all of the variables. Many scientists showed this and retracted the paper from the journal, but it was too late. The public already believed the lie. (I also believe the original scientist later retracted his own statements but I could be wrong on that). As for nowadays when people claim their child got autism after vaccines, that is only an anecdote, not data. You think parents are going to account for every variable? Or that the kid will instantly show they have autism as soon as they&#39;re born? So there&#39;s no need to worry, every good scientific study on vaccines hasn&#39;t found anything problematic. As for getting sick afterwards, same story, although in some cases people can get light flu symptoms and such for a day or two as their immune system learns what to do.",

The truth is that Thimerosal (Mercury) was never banned and remains in vaccines to this day in regular amounts and so called &quot;trace amounts&quot;. Thimerosal is used in multi dose versions of the Flu shot that is given to both children and pregnant women in some cases as well as several other vaccines. Please be aware that Thimerosal used in manufacturing is considered &quot;removed&quot; does not have to be listed on the label. This removal process is not as effective as manufacturers would like you to believe. There is a whole documentary called &quot;Trace Amounts&quot; that tackles this very topic. <br>Vaccine Ingredients............Here is a list of what the CDC says is in vaccines besides the antigen. The Mercury in vaccines is hidden under the name of the preservative Thimerosal (Mercury). These are the known vaccine ingredients. Vaccines may also contain other ingredients that we don&#39;t even know to test for. An example of this is the SV 40 virus that contaminated millions of doses of Polio vaccine. The SV 40 virus is called SV 40 because 39 other monkey viruses where found in Polio before the cancer causing SV 40 virus was found. WI-38 and MRC-5 are human fetal cell tissue lines. We understand how the body reacts when you put foreign tissue in the body with an organ transplant, yet we fail to realized that problems may occur when we do this with vaccines.                 <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/appendices/B/excipient-table-2.pdf\">https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/appendices/B/excipient-table-2.pdf</a>",

The problem with relying on &#39;natural&#39; mechanisms without living a hunter-gatherer lifestyle is that your baby risks having &#39;natural&#39; health aka: a better than even chance of dying before adulthood of a lethal infection as was the case before modern medicine. We&#39;ve studied childhood vaccines and we&#39;ve studied the things they prevent, we know the risks, and we know the benefits are greater. Ever heard of the Iditarod race? Iron lungs? Smallpox?<br><br>No one is saying we shouldn&#39;t be cautious, I&#39;m saying we&#39;ve already taken the necessary precautions, and you are fear-mongering.",

My guess would be that, because different types of infections cause your immune system to make different types of memory cells, different ones may survive for different amounts of time. In the case of chicken pox, though, it may just be because it&#39;s so common that you get a &#39;natural&#39; booster every now and then when you&#39;re exposed to a kid that has it (or if you get a latent infection yourself).",

In fact, there\u2019s less poisonous chemicals in there than the amount you eat in an average day. They also have, as far as I know, stopped putting mercury in vaccines. I\u2019m not trying to attack your belief, I just want health for you and others. Herd immunity is not just a myth. When you don\u2019t get a vaccination, you can get infected and not show symptoms, but still spread the disease. For those who are very young, very old, or are undergoing treatments such as chemotherapy, getting infected can be deadly. The icing on the cake is that if all of us get vaccinated, we can completely kill of some diseases. Again, I\u2019m not trying to attack your beliefs, just trying to keep us all healthy. Also, some of your other reasons could be true, but I think the good outweighs the bad in this case. Have a good day",

How did you know that they learned nothing about vaccine? I first learned about it in middle school, which is saying something.<br>3. Not all doctors need to be able to list every ingredients in a particular vaccine at the top of their head, especially if that isn&#39;t their specialty. Plus, they already have too much to worry about. My mom works in the ICU and she&#39;s still learning and taking tests despite being 40+.<br>4. Yes, most viruses don&#39;t invade us the same way we inject them but injecting them is faster and more convenient. This has no affects on the vaccine&#39;s effectiveness so why wouldn&#39;t we?<br>5. The illnesses boost your immune system by making your body learn and thus remember how to fight them next time, vaccine is just a way to make that process faster and safer, while being just as effective. <br>6. How did you come to the conclusion that the diseases would form immunity against cancer? Viruses and cancer cells are completely different things.<br>7. Actually, your immune system would react to that just fine. Other ingredients is there to preserve the vaccine. They can&#39;t harm you (because they&#39;re in compounds or exist as ions) or are too little to do harm. Think of them like a speck of dust, you inhale a ton of them every moment while talking and breathing but you don&#39;t notice any changes, do you?<br>8.

I work in the lab with antibodies made by immunizing rabbits and donkeys to proteins I need to study so we can label those proteins.

Also, as it has been said before, immunity doesn&#39;t mean you don&#39;t get sick, but rather that your body fights off the disease better.<br>There are white blood cells in your body called T (and B) lymphocytes, which have the ability to &quot;memorize&quot; the biological signature (antigens) of a microbe. But as the years go by, these lymphocytes tend to &quot;forget&quot; what the antigens look like, so that&#39;s why we get booster shots from time to time. <br>(Quick note, rabies is often treated with vaccines).<br>Also, by not getting vaccinated, one runs the risk of exposing other people to a disease, as the the non-vaccinated person might make it easier for the disease to spread, compared to a vaccinated person.<br>Finally, it&#39;s acceptable that big pharmaceutical companies make money off vaccines, as they do off any of the products they sell, because the often reinvest a huge part of those profits into R&amp;D to keep making new medecine.

The shot for it helps a lot given that each generation is based off the last cell. The cells would still recognize the strain and fight against it. Each year the flu shot gets updated with a new generation. But people still get the flu because the chances of the cells recognizing the virus are slimmer given that, while similar, are still different than what the cells know. They are still prepared once they realize the threat is the same.<br><br>About the HIV thing. HIV is insanely hard to prepare for given that the viruses main function impairs that ability to recognize it as a threat. Meaning even a weakened cell of HIV can still lead to the man contracting the disease. That&#39;s why vaccinations in this case wont work. And why the DNA strain injection without any of the viruses attack systems would mean a greater immunity from that strain. Thus vaccinations could work with HIV in that respect. <br><br>To be honest i kinda face palmed at that quote.

It is also very toxic to aquatic organisms and may cause long-term adverse effects in aquatic environments (EC hazard symbol N).[20] In the body, it is metabolized or degraded to ethylmercury (C2H5Hg+) and thiosalicylate.[13]Cases have been reported of severe Mercury poisoning by accidental exposure or attempted suicide, with some fatalities.[21] Animal experiments suggest that thiomersal rapidly dissociates to release ethylmercury after injection; that the disposition patterns of mercury are similar to those after exposure to equivalent doses of ethylmercury chloride; and that the central nervous system and the kidneys are targets, with lack of motor coordination being a common sign. Similar signs and symptoms have been observed in accidental human poisonings. The mechanisms of toxic action are unknown. Fecal excretion accounts for most of the elimination from the body. Ethylmercury clears from blood with a half-life of about 18 days in adults by breakdown into other chemicals, including inorganic mercury. Ethylmercury is eliminated from the brain in about 14 days in infant monkeys. Risk assessment for effects on the nervous system have been made by extrapolating from dose-response relationships for methylmercury.[22] Methylmercury and ethylmercury distribute to all body tissues, crossing the blood\u2013brain barrier and the placental barrier, and ethylmercury also moves freely throughout the body.[23] Concerns based on extrapolations from methylmercury caused thiomersal to be removed from U.S. childhood vaccines, starting in 1999. Since then, it has been found that ethylmercury is eliminated from the body and the brain significantly faster than methylmercury, so the late-1990s risk assessments turned out to be overly conservative.[22] Though inorganic mercury metabolized from ethylmercury has a much longer half-life in the brain, at least 120 days, it appears to be much less toxic than the inorganic mercury produced from mercury vapor, for reasons not yet understood.[22]",

However, unlike real virus/bacteria which would keep infecting more cells and probably attack the lymph node, vaccine is programed to be defeated and for the body immune system to remember the antibody required to fight the same virus/bacteria. So, when real disease enter the body, the antibody would kill it before it could wreack havoc.<br>And if your kids are ill after vaccination, take them to doctors and tell them that you just vaccinate ur kid. The doctor will give some medicine that would ease the illness or make ur kid recover faster. <br>Hey, living is costly. But its a much better alternative than seeing your kids die or be deformed by preventable disease.<br>Vaccinate your kids or buy them coffins.",

It can be acquired by mutations from drugs, chemicals, infections and other environmental causes. That would explain why a perfectly healthy child goes to get a vaccine and hours to days after parents start noticing changes to their child, lack of communication, slurred words; etc. and over time it\u2019s autism. <br>This would also make sense given the fact that a Mississippi study that was done (one of the only studies done that actually compared a completely unvaccinated group to a vaccinated group) showed that children who were vaccinated had a 4.2x the rate of autism that the unvaccinated had. <br><br>This would explain how Dr. Chris Shaw\u2019s studies showed that Aluminum HHS in the brain can lead to motor deficits and motor neuron degeneration. We find these aluminum in childhood vaccines.  Dr. Romain Cherarardi from France concluded that the aluminum can travel up to the brain though the macrophages .  Dr. Christopher Exley (an aluminum specialist) observed the brains of autistic children and found very high rates of aluminum in the brain, even higher than a lot of those with Alzheimer\u2019s. What\u2019s interesting is that the aluminum wasn\u2019t found around the brain or outside of the cells. It was found concentrated in the immune cells. How did the immune cells have it? Maybe because when injected it causes an immune reaction and the macrophages allowed a lot of the aluminum to travel up the brain into the immune cells and Dr. Chris Shaw\u2019s studies showed that this aluminum in the brain can lead to motor deficits and motor neuron degeneration. This would explain the huge increase in Autism rates ever since vaccines started being used widely. I may remind you that there isn\u2019t a such thing as a genetic epidemic.. so there\u2019s a reason that the rates just skyrocketed.. <br><br>Yehoda Shoenfeld from Israel (said to be one of the greatest autoimmune scientists known to man) also stated that there is a link between autism and vaccines. <br><br>And how do you explain this?<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XUM2gvfbW8\">https://youtu.be/1XUM2gvfbW8</a>",

Like I said before, it doesn&#39;t fully develop and show symptoms until a baby is born. In your case, I can&#39;t tell you what exactly you have because I don&#39;t know you. There are 3 levels of Autism based on the severity of it. But I can guarantee you for sure that whatever you or your brother have, it&#39;s not caused by vaccines.",

A Buhdist nun found this out and scraped the puss from the infected with small pox and blew it into the nose of the healthy. The nun saw that people who got small-pox, would NEVER get it again. Later, Edward Jenner went to a Dairy Farm and saw a Dairy Farmer. The woman said she would NEVER get smallpox because she had already gotten CowPox. Jenner saw this and thought that Cow Pox and Small Pox were related. The symptoms of cow pox on humans were WAY less severe. The son of one of the dairy farmers was willing to help so Jenner injected Cow Pox into the boy and the next days he was sick but after that, he NEVER got small pox even when Jenner injected him with it. Soon after his discoveries and many other test subjects, he created a vaccine.",

It was a success.<br>The eight-year-old was inoculated against the disease and this became the first ever vaccine.<br>But why did it work?<br>To understand how vaccines function, we need to know how the immune system defends us against contagious diseases in the first place.<br>When foreign microbes invade us, the immune system triggers a series of responses in an attempt to identify and remove them from our bodies.<br>The signs that this immune response is working are the coughing, sneezing, inflammation and fever we experience, which work to trap, deter and rid the body of threatening things, like bacteria.<br>These innate immune responses also trigger our second line of defense, called adaptive immunity.<br>Special cells called B cells and T cells are recruited to fight microbes, and also record information about them, creating a memory of what the invaders look like, and how best to fight them.<br>This know-how becomes handy if the same pathogen invades the body again. But despite this smart response, there&#39;s still a risk involved.<br>The body takes time to learn how to respond to pathogens and to build up these defenses.<br>And even then, if a body is too weak or young to fight back when it&#39;s invaded, it might face very serious risk if the pathogen is particularly severe.<br>But what if we could prepare the body&#39;s immune response, readying it before someone even got ill?<br>This is where vaccines come in.<br>Using the same principles that the body uses to defend itself, scientists use vaccines to trigger the body&#39;s adaptive immune system, without exposing humans to the full strength disease.<br>This has resulted in many vaccines, which each work uniquely, separated into many different types.<br>First, we have live attenuated vaccines. These are made of the pathogen itself but a much weaker and tamer version.<br>Next, we have inactive vaccines, in which the pathogens have been killed.<br>The weakening and inactivation in both types of vaccine ensures that pathogens don&#39;t develop into the full blown disease. But just like a disease, they trigger an immune response, teaching the body to recognize an attack by making a profile of pathogens in preparation.<br>The downside is that live attenuated vaccines can be difficult to make, and because they&#39;re live and quite powerful, people with weaker immune systems can&#39;t have them, while inactive vaccines don&#39;t create long-lasting immunity.<br>Another type, the subunit vaccine, is only made from one part of the pathogen, called an antigen, the ingredient that actually triggers the immune response. By even further isolating specific components of antigens, like proteins or polysaccharides, these vaccines can prompt specific responses.",

                "text": "This is the enrtire vid in a long nutshell: <br>In 1796, the scientist Edward Jenner<br>injected material from a cowpox virus into an eight-year-old boy<br>with a hunch that this would provide the protection needed<br>to save people from deadly outbreaks of the related smallpox virus.<br>It was a success.<br>The eight-year-old was inoculated against the disease<br>and this became the first ever vaccine.<br>But why did it work?<br>To understand how vaccines function,<br>we need to know how the immune system defends us against contagious diseases<br>in the first place.<br>When foreign microbes invade us,<br>the immune system triggers a series of responses<br>in an attempt to identify and remove them from our bodies.<br>The signs that this immune response is working<br>are the coughing, sneezing, inflammation and fever we experience,<br>which work to trap, deter and rid the body of threatening things, like bacteria.<br>These innate immune responses also trigger our second line of defense,<br>called adaptive immunity.<br>Special cells called B cells and T cells are recruited to fight microbes,<br>and also record information about them,<br>creating a memory of what the invaders look like,<br>and how best to fight them.<br>This know-how becomes handy<br>if the same pathogen invades the body again.<br>But despite this smart response, there&#39;s still a risk involved.<br>The body takes time to learn how to respond to pathogens<br>and to build up these defenses.<br>And even then,<br>if a body is too weak or young to fight back when it&#39;s invaded,<br>it might face very serious risk if the pathogen is particularly severe.<br>But what if we could prepare the body&#39;s immune response,<br>readying it before someone even got ill?<br>This is where vaccines come in.<br>Using the same principles that the body uses to defend itself,<br>scientists use vaccines to trigger the body&#39;s adaptive immune system,<br>without exposing humans to the full strength disease.<br>This has resulted in many vaccines, which each work uniquely,<br>separated into many different types.<br>First, we have live attenuated vaccines.<br>These are made of the pathogen itself but a much weaker and tamer version.<br>Next, we have inactive vaccines, in which the pathogens have been killed.<br>The weakening and inactivation in both types of vaccine<br>ensures that pathogens don&#39;t develop into the full blown disease.<br>But just like a disease, they trigger an immune response,<br>teaching the body to recognize an attack<br>by making a profile of pathogens in preparation.<br>The downside is that live attenuated vaccines can be difficult to make,<br>and because they&#39;re live and quite powerful,<br>people with weaker immune systems can&#39;t have them,<br>while inactive vaccines don&#39;t create long-lasting immunity.<br>Another type, the subunit vaccine,<br>is only made from one part of the pathogen, called an antigen,<br>the ingredient that actually triggers the immune response.<br>By even further isolating specific components of antigens,<br>like proteins or polysaccharides,<br>these vaccines can prompt specific responses.<br>Scientists are now building a whole new range of vaccines<br>called DNA vaccines.<br>For this variety, they isolate the very genes that make the specific antigens<br>the body needs to trigger its immune response to specific pathogens.<br>When injected into the human body,<br>those genes instruct cells in the body to make the antigens.<br>This causes a stronger immune response,<br>and prepares the body for any future threats,<br>and because the vaccine only includes specific genetic material,<br>it doesn&#39;t contain any other ingredients from the rest of the pathogen<br>that could develop into the disease and harm the patient.<br>If these vaccines become a success,<br>we might be able to build more effective treatments<br>for invasive pathogens in years to come.<br>Just like Edward Jenner&#39;s amazing discovery<br>spurred on modern medicine all those decades ago,<br>continuing the development of vaccines<br>might even allow us to treat diseases like HIV,<br>malaria,<br>or Ebola, one day.",

I have researched vaccines for the past 5 years and canot find 1 person to satisfactorily answer my questions.<br>#1 If the herd immunity theory is true, then why is it contradicted by the fact of waning immunity? \u00a0Example: MMR Vaccine wanes in effectiveness X% in 10 years. That means most people will only be X% protected by the vaccines after 10 years. Wouldn\u2019t their be massive outbreaks already? That means most of the population who has been vaccinated aren\u2019t protected.<br><br>#2. If herd immunity theory is correct why are so many people who are vaccinated (protected) so scared if people who aren\u2019t vaccinated (not protected) if in fact the vaccines are so effective?<br><br>#3 Has anyone clearly communicated why vaccines are so full of questionable ingredients? I have not found anyone to explain this. MRC-5? For example? Or any of the other nasty\u2019s in there?<br><br>#4 I have heard a lot of pro vaccination people claim they want to criminalize people who don\u2019t vaccinate because it can harm other people\u2026If you believe in this yet also argue that vaccines are not 100% safe as the media and dr\u2019s claim as well as are not 100% affective, aren\u2019t you criminalizing something that is not yet understood much less can be controlled?",

It seems quite obvious that humanity would not poison itself as many antivaccination supporters claim. Vaccination already saved modern generation from millions of deaths annually and many potential pandemics. Plague, polio, measles, variola, tetanus and many other lethal diseases are mainly beaten thanks to vaccination. Just google for facts.\r<br>2.\tThe second reason is that you will save others. Some people cannot get a vaccine due to health issues and only shield they have is vaccinated people with existing antibodies. Okay, if you don\u2019t care about them, get back to reason number one.\r<br>3.\tThe reason people now refuse to get the vaccine is that their standard of living became so high that many of them just forgot what it means to get seriously sick and that people perceive risks of developing side effect consequences to health as more significant is that they know and see them, but never saw plague or measles. People live a good life today and forget to thank vaccines for it.",

We don&#39;t catch a cold, we eat a cold and it&#39;s the same for everything else. We cause cancer ourselves by eating things that aren&#39;t meant to be inside of us or by the rare case of being exposed to radiation etc etc. So wake up and realise this stuff is not good for us in any way at all!!!",

The only specifically STATED medical goal is the creation of anti-bodies.

One example of many is shortly after the 1976 Swine flu outbreak, a mass immunization program began.

Even Doctors once they do their own research then come to understand the inherent problems with vaccines and some have changed careers to expose the dangers. Many that have put time into the research realise that there are many unanswered questions and it is not as simple as this 7.22 video suggests. Instead of name calling and bad language that mostly seems to be the case with fearful, ignorant people that believe in vaccines, just do your own research into proper studies that are real, that have not got  a another agenda behind them.",

Polymers. <br><br>What is the Polymer?  substances like polythylene, and polypropolne, this is like how we make other things like food, fibers, medicine, and fuel.<br><br>What is being used for mRNA polythylene and polypropolene.<br><br>What do those substances do?  They cause inflammation and immune system reaction in the body. <br><br>How does Science try to hide the substance to keep the immune system reaction down???  They put it in either an Adeno virus vector or phospholipid layer. <br><br>So the mRNA (synthetic) is considered &quot; foreign&quot; by the immune system.  What happens after its clipped into the DNA in the cells of organs and replicates? <br><br>In a study with Mesh there is a FBR response, ( foreign body response), the INNATE IMMUNE SYSTEM CAN MEDIATE TOLERANCE OR REJECTION OF THE TRANSPLANTED MATERIALS.

If you do that to yourself, or allow some eugenicist psychopath to do that to  you, and it doesn&#39;t make you immune to a disease, will you be surprised? Will you be so surprised that you literally don&#39;t believe it didn&#39;t work, and then try to lie to yourself that the only possible reason it didn&#39;t work is because you didn&#39;t force everyone else to do the same? That is literally the \u201cherd immunity\u201d argument. My argument is simple. Injecting toxic chemicals and biological waste into your blood causes severe illnesses and most certainly does not make you immune to any disease at all. I have nothing more to say to you.",

As standard, the adaptive immunity is actually known as the 3rd line of defence, not the second line. the first line of defence is the physical, chemical and microbiological barriers to infection such as lysozyme in tears, hydrochloric acid in the stomach and the presence of keratinised, unbroken skin.  The second line is what happens once an infection has entered the body&#39;s systems, and includes actions such as inflammation response, general phagocytosis of pathogens and the action of complement. Therefore the 3rd line of defence is the adaptive response which is specific and has memory via the action of T and B lymphocytes. I used to always direct my 16-18yo students to TED videos but now I will reconsider. This video was far below my expectations.",

                "text": "Scientists use vaccines to trigger the body\u2019s adaptive immune system without exposing humans to the full strength disease. Basically to prepare before a disease enters the body. There are a lot of different type of vaccines. First, we have the live attenuated vaccines. This are made of the pathogen itself it a much weaker and tamer version. Then we have, inactive vaccines, in which the pathogens have been killed. The weakening and inactivation in both types of vaccine  ensures that photogenic don\u2019t develop into the full blown disease. They trigger an immune response teaching the body to recognize an attack by making a profile of pathogens in preparation. The down sides is that live attenuated vaccines can be difficult to make and because they are live and quite powerful, people with weaker immune system can\u2019t have them, while inactive vaccines don\u2019t create long-lasting immunity. Another type, the subunit vaccine. It is only made from on part of the pathogen called antigen, the ingredient that actually triggers the immune response. By even further isolating specific components of antigens, like proteins or polysaccharides, these vaccines can prompt specific responses. Scientists are building a new vaccine called DNA vaccine. For this variety, they isolate the very genes that make specific antigens the body needs to trigger its immune response to specific pathogens. When injected into the human body, those genes instruct cells in the body to make antigens. This causes a stronger immune response, and prepares the body for any future threats and because the vaccine only includes specific genetic material, it doesn\u2019t contain any other ingredients from the rest of the pathogen that could develop into the disease and harm the patient. If these vaccines become a success we might be able to build more effective treatments for invasive pathogens in years to come.",

I am pro vaccine all the way, I just don&#39;t know what to believe about the covid vaccines. I understand that the mRNA vaccines are just spike proteins that tell your cells how to make those spike proteins so we know how to recognize them and fight them in the future. I&#39;m not sure how that is any different from any other vaccine. Can somebody please shed some light on this? It seems like anti vaxers are just fear mongering.",

                "text": "18 Key questions you MUST ask yourself before getting the Jab<br>-Is the \u2018mRNA Jab\u2019 actually a vaccine?<br>Govt: &quot;NO. We purposefully changed the wording in the U.S.-Federal register last Oct.2020 so we could rush the approval for EAU. What we are providing all of you is: an \u2018EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGICAL GENE THERAPY IMMUNE-MODULATORY INJECTION\u2019. We are injecting a SYNTHETIC form of nucleic acid. It is considered a \u2018MEDICAL DEVICE and therefore DOES NOT fall under the definition of a \u2018vaccine\u2019 &quot;<br><br>If I&#39;m Pregnant, and I discuss this with my doctor are they required to document the risks and benefits of the vaccine in my patient chart?<br>Govt: &quot;NO, Although we (the Govt. and Vaccine companies have complete freedom from liability, your doctor may be held liable for your care during your pregnancy and delivery. So we (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists- ACOG) thought it would be best to not require your doctor to document if they had this discussion with you so that there be no obstacles between you and receiving the vaccine. But if something BAD did happen after your jab, you won&#39;t be able to put the blame on your doctor because they would not have any documentation that they had this discussion with you.  In the end, your body, your choice.\u201d<br><br>Were there any \u2018INDEPENDENT\u2019 Observer groups (without any conflict of interest) looking at the data during the initial trials?<br>Govt: &quot;NO&quot;<br><br>I get vaccinated can I stop wearing a mask(s)?<br>Govt: &quot;NO&quot;<br><br>If I get vaccinated will the restaurants, bars, schools, fitness clubs, hair salons, etc. reopen and will people be able to get back to work like normal?<br>Govt: &quot;NO&quot;<br><br>If I get vaccinated will I be resistant to Covid?<br>Govt: &quot;Maybe. We don&#39;t know exactly, but probably not.&quot;<br><br>If I get vaccinated, at least I won&#39;t be contagious to others - right?<br>Govt: &quot;NO. the vaccine doesn\u2019t stop transmission.&quot;<br><br>If I get vaccinated, how long will the vaccine last?<br>Govt: &quot;No one knows. All \u2018Covid vaccines\u2019 are still in the experimental stage. Maybe 3-9 months?&quot;<br><br>If I get vaccinated, can I stop social distancing?<br>Govt: &quot;NO&quot;<br>If my parents, grandparents and myself all get vaccinated can we hug each other again?<br>Govt: &quot;NO&quot; EDIT: GOVERNMENT: YES<br><br>So what&#39;s the benefit of getting vaccinated?<br>Govt: &quot;Hoping that the virus won&#39;t kill you, and you get to VIRTUE SIGNAL to all the world via social media!!!&quot;<br><br>Are you sure the vaccine won&#39;t injure or kill me?<br>Govt: &quot;NO, there is not enough longitudinal data.  YOU may suffer a brain stroke though. It\u2019s still under EUA due to lack of safety data&quot;<br><br>If statistically the virus won&#39;t kill me (99.7% survival rate), why should I get vaccinated?<br>Govt: &quot;To protect others&quot;<br><br>If I get vaccinated, I can protect 100% of people I come in contact with?&quot;<br>Govt: &quot;NO&quot;<br><br>If I get the vaccine, I and I get exposed to the original or other variants I should be fine right?<br>Govt.: \u201cNO\u201d- It is possible that you may have a hyper-immune reaction known as the \u2018Cytokine storm\u2019 when you eventually get exposed sometime at a later date after your vaccination.<br><br>If I do experience a severe adverse reaction, long term effects (still unknown) or die from the vaccine will I (or my family) be compensated from the vaccine manufacturer or the Government?<br>Govt: &quot;NO - the government and vaccine manufacturers have 100% zero liability regarding this experimental drug&quot;<br><br>There isn\u2019t any conflict of interest between the Government and the Vaccine industry  is there?<br>Govt: \u201cNO. But we (NIH) do co-hold the PATENT for this \u2018Vaccine\u2019 with Moderna\u201d<br><br>Is there a safe and effective alternative to the vaccine?<br>Govt: \u201cofficially-NO\u201d  If we \u2018officially\u2019 acknowledge IVERMECTIN as an effective treatment, we would be obligated to revoke the EAU status of all the vaccines. <br>In summary, the Covid19 vaccine...<br>\u2022Does not have any data on the safety of efficacy on pregnant women or the unborn child.<br>\u2022Does not provide immunity<br>\u2022Does not eliminate the virus<br>\u2022Does not prevent death<br>\u2022Does not guarantee you won\u2019t get it<br>\u2022Does not stop you from passing it on to others<br>\u2022Does not eliminate the need for travel bans<br>\u2022Does not eliminate the need for business closures<br>\u2022Does not eliminate the need for lockdowns<br>\u2022Does not eliminate the need for masking<br>\u2022Does have the possibility of a hyper-immune reaction known as the \u2018Cytokine storm\u2019 because of your Covid vaccination<br>\u2022 NIH co-holds the PATENT for mRNA Vaccine with ModerRNA (The fox watching the hen-house)<br>\u2022 Does not meet the definition of a vaccine: \u2018mRNA Vaccine\u2019 Jab is an \u2018EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGICAL GENE THERAPY IMMUNE-MODULATORY INJECTION\u2019<br>-Consider prophylaxis and early treatment with Ivermectin.

This is done to minimize adverse events. It is also a fact that all vaccine manufactures use other vaccines, and sometimes pure heavy metals such as aluminum (as was done with the HPV vaccine ) as placebos. A full review of all the fraudulent techniques used in vaccine trail research is summarized in a book called &quot;Vaccines - a reappraisal&quot; by Dr. Moskowitz.

An important part of the healing process for me is to be active in herpes education, support and advocacy. I volunteer in a number of Herpes\u00a0 organizations, and in particular Positive Men, because the impact of Herpes on women is very different from men. I was\u00a0 once a herpes positive, I will forever be grateful to God Almighty and\u00a0Dr Elinfoh Herbal Home\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0for reaching me when I thought it was all over, Today I am happy with my family living free. After the medical doctor confirmed Herpes status Negative, after 3 weeks on Dr Elinfoh\u00a0 herbs . I have never in my life believed that herpes\u00a0 could be cured by any herbal medicine i first doubted but i have no choice but to trust and believe him and today i am happy to say i am Herpes free, He can as well cure the following disease;\u00a0<br>HERPES SIMPLEX VIRUS 1&amp;2 [HSV]<br>CANCER<br>ASTHMA<br>CHRONIC DISEASE<br>LUPUS<br>DIABETICS 1&amp;2<br>FIBROMYALGIA<br>HEPATITIS A, B,C<br>ARTHRITISFIBROID\u00a0I want to make sure that herpes never happens to anyone else. We can&#39;t prevent herpes\u00a0 by punishment, by stigma and discrimination. It&#39;s only through building a safe, supportive and caring environment, that positive people still have hope and they should contact Dr. Elinfoh via email: drelinfohherbalhome@gmail.com\u00a0Together we fight to become healthy. You can also call or Whatsapp him via his cell +2348110492072 THANKS .",

After that there isn&#39;t much of a trend. The overall test for trend, which I think is in the text, is significantly negative. That is driven by this finding here. What happens here is that these premature children which are at high risk of having a disorder, or that is what we assume, are simply not being vaccinated and that results in an artificially high estimate for this zero group.&quot;.... Pg. 45 \r<br>\r<br>Dr. Verstraeten: In conclusion, the screening analysis suggests a possible association between certain neurologic developmental disorders. Namely Tics, attention deficit disorder, speech and language disorders and exposure to mercury from Thimerosal containing vaccines before the age of six months. Pg. 50\r<br>\r<br>Dr. Johnson : ....&quot; <b>Our first male in the line of the next generation, and I do not want that grandson to get a Thimerosal containing\u00b7vaccine until we know better what is going on.</b> It will probably take a long time. In the meantime, and I know there are probably implications for this internationally, but in the meanwhile I think I want that grandson to only be given Thimerosal-free vaccines.&quot;.... Pg. 200 of transcript\r<br>\r<br>Dr. Brent : ....&quot; The medical/legal findings in this study, causal or not, are horrendous and therefore it is important that the suggested epidemiological, pharmacokinetic and animal studies be performed.&quot;...  ....&quot;So, we are in a bad position from the standpoint of defending any lawsuits if they were initiated and I am concerned. &quot;....

There was no evidence to suggest that waning immunity was a contributing factor among the vaccine failures.\u201d\r<br>\r<br>THE VACCNATED GET MEASLES:\r<br>\ud83d\udd34  \u201cFrom December 9, 1983, to January 13, 1984, 21 cases of measles occurred in Sangamon County, Illinois.* Nine of the cases were confirmed serologically. The outbreak involved 16 high school students, all of whom had histories of measles vaccination after 15 months of age documented in their school health records.\u201d\r<br>\u201cThe affected high school had 276 students and was in the same building as a junior high school with 135 students. A review of health records in the high school showed that all 411 students had documentation of measles vaccination on or after the first birthday, in accordance with Illinois law.\u201d\r<br><a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00000359.htm\">https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00000359.htm\r</a><br>\r<br>\r<br>\ud83d\udd342019 May:  Physicians for Informed Consent    May 1 at 2:36 PM \u00b7 \r<br>Did you know that a third dose of MMR is unlikely to solve the problem of waning measles immunity?\r<br>\r<br>\u201cWhile a third MMR dose may successfully immunize the rare individual who did not respond after 2 doses, MMR3 (a third dose of MMR) is unlikely to solve the problem of waning immunity in the United States....

The maidens believed they would be immune to small pox by catching the cow pox. NOT the same virus.  Jenner&#39;s &quot;vaccine&quot; was to take the pus of cowpox and smear it upon the lanced skin of a patient.  That was it.  That was the &quot;scientific test.&quot;  Because the boy did not become sick with small pox when smeared after with small pox - THAT was the test that determined the fate of vaccines.  Doctors of the time wrote that the spread of small pox and other diseases like diphtheria, syphilis, and cholera and others was because of this smearing of pus cowpox and from pus small pox.  There was heavy controversy and protest at that time, so much so that a mandate for forced vaccination was ruled or fines and imprisonment.  Many were jailed.  There was no &quot;science.&quot;  This does not equate to immunity, as not all people became sick from small pox of those living with them, or those caring for them like nurses without vaccination.  There were no double-blind, placebo studies at that time.  And no blood work either, as the bacteria or virus of the small pox could NOT BE DETERMINED.  AT THAT TIME they could not find the organism that PRODUCED small pox!  So how could they be scientifically assured that it was the small pox organism that was being &quot;eradicated&quot; with the vaccine, when that nor any antibodies could be identified???  How did they know it was not just the person&#39;s immune system?   And every diseases where no vaccine is available, the disease outbreak always wanes on it&#39;s own.  Like Ebola and others.  So how do we know the quieting of a disease is because of a vaccine?  No double-blind, placebo study has ever been performed for ANY EXISTING VACCINE.  THAT is not science-based as what they have us believe.  Research that.",

It is twisted genius in action, making intelligent, independent-thinking people ignore their honest, well-founded vaccine skepticism, and causing the rest to accept unlimited vaccinations without question.<br><br>\u00a0There are two primary reasons why vaccinating oneself cannot protect others, and why failing to vaccinate cannot endanger others. The first is from the science of immunology, and we can describe it as waning antibody stimulation, post-vaccination. In short, vaccines only do one thing-stimulate antibody production to something similar but not the same as the infection. That antibody stimulation is temporary, lasting only a few months or years. So the majority of the US population has had no so-called vaccine &quot;protection&quot; for several decades, without any resurgent epidemics of measles, mumps, pertussis, etc.<br><br>The second is from the science of population outcomes, or epidemiology. In all populations globally who have ever attained the ever-rising and completely arbitrary (made up) minimum threshold for vaccine uptake (% of a population who get vaccinated), outbreaks of vaccinated diseases still occur. This should, of course, be impossible, if herd immunity were actually true.",

They are autistic, albiet high-functioning, but they have a unique and beautiful perspective on things that will certainly add to the world in some way. I don&#39;t see their autism (whether or not it was caused by vaccines) as a bad thing. It is a challenge to deal with, but that&#39;s okay. My mother, on the other hand, has struggled with a crippled leg most of her life. And while she never complains, it has definitely held her back and made her life a constant struggle. If vaccines really did mean you had to choose between horrible, life-altering diseases or autism, I absolutely would choose vaccines and autism.",

If you&#39;re not immune-compromised or deal with those who are on a regular basis, then just don&#39;t get the flu vaccine and you&#39;re good.  No thiomersal, and no diptheria, tetanus, pertussis, measles, mumps, rubella, or varicella while you&#39;re at it.<br>We&#39;re trying to drive a bunch of really nasty stuff into extinction, would you like to participate, please?",

The actual physical amount is. So even if you were close to being right, the amount of mercury that was in the vaccines you&#39;re referring to were orders of magnitude lower than that in many foods. Thimerosal has an LD-50 of roughly 91 mg/kg. Caffeine has an LD-50 of 127 mg/kg, so unless you&#39;re drinking enough coffee to kill a teenager, you could make coffee with thimerosal and not get sick.<br><br><br>For two, it&#39;s not mercury that was in vaccines. Saying there was mercury in vaccines is like saying there&#39;s chlorine in your table salt, or coal in your diamond. The things you&#39;re referring to are radically different and have radically different properties, stop grouping them together.<br><br><br>The primary danger with heavy metals is that your body can&#39;t eliminate them.

The only way is to try to convince them of why they are wrong. People who are toxic to antivacsers calling them rude names and such, which can be reasonable due to frustration (trust me),  but this is not the solution as hatred breeds more hatred and the more people denounce them the worse it can get sometimes. This is by no means saying that antivacs is acceptable, but should&#39;t be treated with more ignorance due to frustration. Plus its funny to prove them wrong and frustrate them by politely asking them to show such arcticals that proved aperently that vaccines cause autism and are a byproduct of Satan and Hitler  and then getting blocked due to them not having any proper evidence to their argument.",

The pro vaccine agenda is so weak in science that the pundits will not debate anti-vaxxers because their arguments do no hold up to public scrutiny.  Here are some facts that the &quot;authorities&quot; will never tell you because they make so much money from vaccines they are unwilling to jeopardize this cash cow. <br>1) Vaccines have never been through a study with an inert placebo to test for safety.<br>2) Vaccines have a list of adverse effects listed on the vaccine insert including encephalopathy<br>3) Encephalopathy causes autism like symptoms.<br>4) Many ingredients in vaccines cause disease in humans.  The short list is :Mercury, aluminum, polysorbate 80, formaldehyde, aborted fetal tissue, green monkey kidney tissue, bovine serum and many more.<br>5) The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System VAERS reports over four hundred people killed each year from vaccines.  This could be many time higher.<br>6) Human Health Services claims that only a fraction of adverse events are reported.<br>7) All diseases we vaccinate for were on a steep decline before vaccines were introduced.<br>8) Scarlet fever killed many people back in the day.  There has never been a vaccine for it and it is not an issue today.<br>9) There were no peanut allergies before they started using peanut oil as an adjuvant in vaccines.<br>10)The vaccine industry has no liability if you are harmed by a vaccine so they have no incentive to make them safe.<br>11) The US has the highest infant mortality rate among the industrialized nations.  We also vaccinate more than all the industrial nations and are the only one that vaccinates on the first day of life.  <br>12)The US has the highest rates of autoimmune disease in the world.  54% of children in the US have an autoimmune disease.  <br>13) Pilot studies show that health outcomes for those not vaccinated are far superior to those who have been vaccinated.<br>14) Health officials will not do a study of fully vaccinated vs. those who have had no vaccines even though they have that information already in the medical data bases.<br>15) The real death rate from measles in the first world is 1.6 per one hundred thousand people.

In fact some times they even cause other people to die as they do not vaccinate there children. So they are making it so there children are at risk of disease and if any of them is sick, it can lead to the disease being spread more. We can see this with measles. Less people get side affects (nobody usually dies maybe only a few people 1 or 2) from vaccination than getting a disease which would happen for anti vaxxers. A big problem with anti vaxxers is they convince other people leading to herd immunity not working.  Herd immunity is when enough people are vaccinated so they prevent others who can\u2019t be vaccinated due to allergies or diseases they have. If you get vaccinated you could save people who can\u2019t get vaccinated if you can get vaccinated than take advantage of that option. Watch the video it explains this.",

If someone had the MMR vaccine, (Mumps, Measles, and Rubella), and some one does not, that person that does not have the vaccination can actually spread the disease to those that have it, because of the rate that measles replicates and sudden exposure to that many measles viruses that it can overwhelm the vaccinated persons antibodies, usually the vaccinated person can fight it off better and has the disease less intensely than the unvaccinated person. But not always. The vaccination only works because it never allows the virus to get to the point of mass reproduction where it can cause an infection. So since the person is unvaccinated and they have a fully matured infection of measles they can spread it to vaccinated people. I personally think that parents that do not get their kids vaccinated for polio, mmr, and all these diseases that just 70 years ago were killing people in droves they should be arrested for child endangerment, and being a public  health threat. They are creating a biological wepson by lowering our herd immunity",

NCVIA&#39;s purpose was to eliminate the potential financial liability of vaccine manufacturers due to vaccine injury claims[1] to ensure a stable market supply of vaccines, and to provide cost-effective arbitration for vaccine injury claims.[2] Under the NCVIA, the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (NVICP) was created to provide a federal no-fault system for compensating vaccine-related injuries or death by establishing a claim procedure involving the United States Court of Federal Claims and special masters.[1][3]",

You forgot to mention Poul Thorson, who was indicted for falsifying data at the CDC and who was found to be in collusion with big pharma who wanted him to find studies which proved no link between autism and thimerisol.  Well he had to falsify data and cherry pick (as all of those epidemiological studies you referred to). Also Andrew Wakefield NEVER admitted to falsifying data, you lie!   He simply made a correlation and the backlash he received is indicative of the conspiracy in play... ever heard of Vaccine court? Yeah thats where parents affected by vaccines go to receive settlements from big pharma when their child gets injured by vaccines, stuff like autism.  In fact there are numerous studies that show a link between autism and thimerisol.  Its easier to lie to someone than to convince someone they&#39;ve  been lied to.  If you spend the 100s of hours I have researching this you wouod know that vaccines are not safe, and not effective.",

It is as much a force of nature as the water cycle or nuclear fusion.<br><br>Want to know why there&#39;s a new flu vaccine each year? Because influenza is a virus, and viruses mutate very rapidly. This is a form of evolution. Or, if you want to go onto a larger scale, look at your own body. I am, of course, assuming that you are a human and not some sort of proto-hominid which, considering your critical thinking skills, may or may not be closer to the truth. But going past insults, the appendix is one lovely little trinket left in our bodies by evolution. It does nothing but store cellulose. What is the point of that? Cellulose is indigestible. Its only purpose in a human diet is to make passing waste easier. It&#39;s not like releasing cellulose into the intestine will encourage regularity either. The conclusion? It is a remnant of a time when our ancestors COULD digest cellulose in some capacity.<br><br>Or what about our body hair and how it stands on end when we are cold or scared. The only animals that experience this are hairy. Why? Because having a lot of body hair makes such a reaction hold in body heat more efficiently and makes the subject seem to be larger and, thus, more intimidating against whatever it is they are afraid of. We have very little body hair. So little that this is not going to affect heat retention or intimidation in any meaningful way. Why do we do this then? Like the appendix, it must seem rather pointless, yes?<br><br>Do not delude yourself. We, along with every other organism on this planet, are the products of evolution.\ufeff",

You are not protecting your children at all by not vaccinating them, you are exposing them to all sorts of diseases that have been ALMOST extinct for decades. Washing your hands will have little to no effect on diseases like measles A) because they are airborne, B)because the frequency at which you wash your hands is not sufficient to prevent the disease spreading and c) because most people do not wash their hands well enough. Stop your self righteous BS, making up facts to support your case because you are stupid enough to believe in conspiracy theories. Ask yourself how the people in charge of the &quot;conspiracy&quot; protect themselves from the disease? Point made. Vaccines are a blessing and anyone who thinks as you do should be prevented from having children for the greater good of humanity. And stop calling people cannibals, that means you eat people. So what if the grow the disease on dead babies? They have to grow them on something and they are just that, DEAD. The babies don&#39;t care and make a very good growth medium for the disease. Otherwise they are just going to be destroyed which is not any better. If you respond don&#39;t tell me that I&#39;m being aggressive or any of that garbage. You are an idiot, this is a fact.

They will have slight differences due to independent assortment, cross matching and random mutations that occur every time your cells decide. This is because when DNA replicates the enzymes that are involved can make mistakes under very specific circumstances and even though this is unlikely, there are a lot of opportunities when dealing with a 2m long molecule. Some of these genetic variations are negative, like for instance cystic fibrosis is caused by a mutation which causes a protein produced in the lungs to be made incorrectly and it looses functionality allowing mucus to build up and voila, cystic fibrosis (citation on disease specifics needed). Some of these mutations will have little or no effect at all, sometimes a mutation in the third sequence of a base triplet won&#39;t change anything as it may code for the same amino acid anyway. However some of these variations will be positive.",

Billions, maybe even trillions of individual bacteria will all have slight genetic mutations giving them slightly different traits. Just due to chance because the mutations are random, you may end up with a bacterium which has developed a gene for immunity to a certain drug. This works by changing its proteins in such a way that the mechanism the drug used to kill the bacterium will no longer work(citation needed) so if the drug is used, every bacterium would be killed except that one. Meaning it survives and reproduces meaning it&#39;s traits are carried on. The rise of so called superbugs is a result of this. Except it happens when bacteria in a hospital environment are exposed to hundreds of drugs and eventually become resistant to all of them by the same process. Hence why MRSA now exists",

Negative mutations that cause a problem will cause those individuals to die out at a faster rate hence removing the negative genes from a population. Be aware though that the more complex an organism and the longer its generation cycle, the slower this happens and also that an argument could be made that humans have stopped evolving because modern medicine prevents those with genetic flaws from dying like they would naturally and this prevents the genes from being eliminated",

And EVEN IF THAT WAS ALL TRUE, IT STILL IS TOTALLY MINISCULE in compared to those killed just by any individual one of the diseases that have all but been eliminated by vaccines. Once again, YOU GOT NOTHING",

When you&#39;re comfy at home it&#39;s easy to say you&#39;d like to die there but when your heart is failing or you need a respirator to not expire it&#39;s a lot more difficult to refuse medical care.

Also, vaccines, have, since they first started being developed been used to try and fully exterminate diseases by inoculating whole populations, that&#39;s not new, it can and has worked twice (rinderpest in cattle, smallpox in humans, and <b>almost</b> polio).<br>Now, getting a vaccine is almost always much less risky than going without it (both for you and those around you), but what about your suggestion?<br><br>The problem with trying to make individualized vaccines tailored to peoples&#39; genotypes is threefold:<br>First, genetics and immunology aren&#39;t advanced enough yet (and may not be for decades or more) for us to know how to make individual vaccines that specific people will respond better to. We just don&#39;t know enough about how the body works to do that.<br><br>Second: (and here I&#39;m wildly estimating, I don&#39;t work in vaccine R&amp;D) Vaccines are REALLY expensive to develop, on the order of tens of many millions of dollars. If you had to develop new vaccines for every single person, no one could ever afford them.<br><br>And finally, it&#39;s not necessary: most vaccines work fine for most people.

Back then, we protected the immunocompromised by quarantining those who were sick. Now we have more people with compromised immunity than ever before and more adults without proper protection from many diseases.

                        "text": "nightsage217<br>There are 4 main ways of teaching behaviors, divided into positive and negative, punishments and rewards (positive not meaning &quot;good&quot;, but &quot;adding something&quot;, and negative not meaning &quot;bad&quot;, but &quot;removing something&quot;). Through many decades of research, we know the effectiveness rankings of these methods, and positive punishments (adding something unliked to stop an unwanted behavior...like hitting) are the least effective method. That doesn&#39;t mean it doesn&#39;t work at all, just that it&#39;s the least effective way to teach of those main 4. (For the curious, positive rewards are the most effective, followed by negative rewards, followed by negative punishment, followed last by positive punishment. And for examples of each, positive rewards are like giving them a small gift of some sort when they do something particularly good; negative rewards are like letting them skip chores or have a later bedtime if they do something good; negative punishment is grounding; and positive punishment is hitting or screaming. For adults, which, yes, also have disciplinary action on them, positive rewards are like subsidies or bonuses at work; negative rewards are like lowered insurance premiums; negative punishment is like prison (if it were done properly...which is another issue altogether); and positive punishment is like extra fees, fines, or charges.)",

But many do not understand the significance of this fact, and have been made to believe that if you\u2019re vaccinated, you won\u2019t carry viruses, and therefore, others will be protected because you\u2019re vaccinated.

Regardless, in that thread I responded and answered that no one has ever claimed a vaccination prevents 100% of viruses and bacteria from being carried.

If your carrying the virus and have have symptoms you will spread the virus. But if you are also carrying the virus and not showing symptoms you will also spread the virus.  Preventing infection is independent of spreading while you have the virus in or on you. <br>Also Remember exposure does not automatically mean infection either.  When exposed  one can spread it without infectiin. You may or may not ever show symptoms and if you do or not is really irrelevant to spreading. Having symptoms does not equate with spreading the disease more or less then not having symptoms. <br><br>As a matter of fact , if you show symptoms you will probably stay home to prevent spreading the virus. <br>Vaccines should help you prevent infection when they work (Remember CDC says vaccines don&#39;t work -100 percent) but when people say unvaccinated people put others in more danger then vaccinated it simply is not true and I really have a problem with the word &quot;more&quot;<br>It truly is a marketing ploy because if immunity can not prevent you from carrying then it obviously it can not prevent you from spreading. <br><br>Also keep in mind that vaccinated people can shed the virus for weeks to longer then a month after vaccination. And today with genetic technology we can and have identified the virus in many measles patients (plus many more ) as the same virus that was used in the vaccine via its genetic finger print.  In the past , we would have simply assumed it can&#39;t be the very virus that we just vaccinated against. <br><br>It is so much more complicated then simple sound bytes we are constantly bombarded with.  <br> Remember , only natural infection can give you lifetime immunaty which is why they tried the nasal vaccines. it modeled natural infection better. Except you don&#39;t get all the toxic things that come with it in the wild. <br>",

Any attempt to place life inside of death is pure folly. The test to determine if a person represents the all powerful Creator has always been whether they bring the gift of eternal life to the table and consequently can tell you what death is and what is inside of death. It is clear that you serve a god who does not have the power to grant eternal life. If you worship god in this life, you have to die and go back inside the sun where Nature put Abel, who you worship as god. All the religious can do is lie and that is what they do and have done since the very beginning. Nature keeps her draft picks in this life eternally. The religious undoubtedly would like to see an end to this earth. There will be no end to this earth. Where the Bible refers to the end, it means the end of religion and death</b>",

Autism is something you are born with and not something you catch. I have a hyper-functioning form of Autism. I function like a normal human being, and have many online friends. There really is no difference between me and someone who doesn&#39;t have Autism (rather than personality) Other than the fact I do have it. I do take medication for multiple other things, ADD, ADHD, and OCD. But the medicine really helps. I once went a few days without my depression medication and broke down in fear of death and what &quot;eternity&quot; meant and had to be comforted by my parents. I&#39;m a foot taller than both my parents, yet i had to hug and cry on their shoulders for comfort. When I was young, I don&#39;t remember this myself, but after all these years my parents do. I once told them &quot;My mind is like a city with no stop signs.&quot;. Basically, my mind wouldn&#39;t stop running around and I could never have a quiet head. That&#39;s all gone now with my medication. The only problem I have with it is actually getting it with all the medication red-tape here in America. So please. I will get my child vaccinated. I don&#39;t want them suffering from Measles or any other disease. I rather them get Autism (even though they won&#39;t) than have them die and be a grieving father for my whole life. I feel bad for the children that won&#39;t be vaccinated and be put through such a horrible illness or possibly death all because of their parent&#39;s ignorance.",

You are generalizing negligence of some and informed parental decisions of others into one category; making the notion that ALL individuals should be forced into a medical procedure (vaccines are a pharmaceutical drug with risks even noted by the CDC). In my opinion, taking the responsibility by making the informed decision as to what enters your child&#39;s bloodstream should be viewed as commendable as apposed to negligence or incompetence as per your comment. There is no &quot;one size fits all&quot; medical approach in any circumstance, so why should vaccines be viewed and distributed as such?",

In order for a pharmaceutical drug to be deem effective would be to undergo Placebo trials. Unfortunately this is not the case with vaccines, since the tests and studies are performed by the vaccine manufacturers themselves, which is a conflict of interest. Another reason would be the countless chemicals and ingredients included with these vaccines. Some are even propagated using human diploid cells (aborted fetal tissues), and I personally would not feel comfortable inoculating a child with such substances. But, in the end we all get to make our own decisions as to what we subject out bodies to. And as much as you wish vaccines were mandated for whatever militant textbook reasons you have, it will never happen. People are not blind to the detrimental effects of these shots, and the veil of the pharmaceutical industry is slowly being lifted to expose it&#39;s true objectives.

Fish contains more way mercury than a vaccine. Formaldehyde is natural thing produced by the body. Fruits like pears and apples are extremely high in formaldehyde compared to a vaccine. The aborted fetal cells are needed in only  a few vaccines and these cells, more specifically, the WI-38 cell line is a human diploid fibroblast cell line came from three month old fetus aborted in 1962 in the US and MRC-5, came from lung fibroblasts of a 14 week old fetus in 1966 in England. They don&#39;t use recently aborted children or are in cahoots with Planned Parent hood to get more. So technically that does belong in the body as it is human cells. Aluminum acts as a adjuvant and an adjuvant increases immune responses to antigens. The amounts put it are safe and you can find it in drinking water, baby formula, and baking soda. MSG is a stabilizer. About 1/2 cup of peas contains 48 times the glutamate in Varivax and 127 times the amount in FluMist vaccines.

So for the sake of your children do research and help stop the spread of disease.

I don&#39;t even know where to start.<br><br>First off, the only evidence I see in this video is antiquated science and parroting of a faulty belief system based of false knowledge gained from sources like the corrupt CDC, who holds patents on vaccines and sells them like candy to brainwashed doctors and pediatricians. By the time vaccines were introduced, diseases were already quickly declining thanks to sanitation, hygeine, plumbing, and isolation of the ones who already had the disease (not vaccination). If you did your actual unbiased, non.profit research, you would know this.<br><br>You would also know that there has been more injuries and deaths caused by vaccines than they have prevented. In fact, there is no way of even proving that have prevented anything (going back to the cleaner world causing diseases to decline before they were even manufactured). Around 3.6 billion dollars has been given out to parents whose children have been injured or died because of vaccines. This is not common public knowledge because we cannot sue vaccine manufacturers when our child is harmed, but there is a vaccine court and something called a vaccine trust fund. For every vaccine produced, money goes into this trust fund (because they know kids will be hurt and due from their vaccines and they could care less). Families get a settlement from this trust fund when their kid get detrimentally harmed or injured from a vaccine or multiple vaccines. This is done on purpose so that they do not have to face liability in the public eye, so people keep blindly buying their vaccines.<br><br>Children who are vaccinated also have MUCH weaker immune systems and very likely to die from the BENIGN disease that are vaccinating against If they get it later in life because their body does not know how to fight it naturally. Also, they are more of a danger than unvaccinated kids because they are silent carriers of those diseases their whole lives and they also shed the disease (meaning that could give it to any child, vaccinated or unvaccinated at any time). The diseases we vaccinate against are very benign and non life threatening and/or already eradicated in the US. If we stay clean and eat healthy, we will be fine. It is all fear mongering so the public keeps buying vaccines.<br><br>Lastly, God has no say in my life because he is a fictional character. You are spitting in the faces and on the graves of children who died from vaccines or are injured when you say that my children deserve to be taken away and I&#39;m an unfit parent if I don&#39;t vaccinate. The earth is not flat. Climate change is real. Vaccines are poison. I&#39;m so sorry for your children if they end up injured or dying from all the vaccines you shoot them up with. Have a nice day. I&#39;ll put some actual non biased, non profit sources for you to look into below. You can choose to watch them or not. Your perogative.",

By doing a Google search for &quot;are vaccines bad&quot; and not looking up all the ingredients in vaccines and how they have affected people (injured and killed children that you are disrespecting and not giving two shits about in your biased perspective)  and why the cdc &quot;discredited&quot; Wakefield (they hold parents in vaccines and get paid everytime that sell them) This is also the reason you see way more good about vaccines than the harsh truth. Everyone is brainwashed and/or gets paid off of vaccines, so why would they tell the truth. Doctors get paid for every vaccine they give and all that are taught in medical school is push vaccines. They are great. They are not taught the ingredient or the effects they have or anything other than tell parents to give them and tell the parents that are crazy if they don&#39;t. No real education on the matter. I can see that you don&#39;t care about the unbiased info I presented you. You just care about being pro vaccine. It seems like you are trying to convince yourself because of all the fear mongering about the benign diseases vaccine are falsely said to protect against. I am sorry the media has done this to you and that the agencies that are supposed to be in charge of the public health actually only care about the money and not the people so all you see is false statiatsics and a one sided narrative. <br><br>I am proud to be a mom who knows the truth and is not going to poison my children so the CDC and ignorant doctors keep getting paid. You call tell me I&#39;m a bad mom all you want. I know you are just confused and it makes me sad for the future of our children. By 2025, one in two children will be autistic, because, yes, vaccines are one factor in causing autism, along with a ton of other ailments and death.

But by not getting vaccinated, you not only put yourself but others around you are in danger of getting ill. That&#39;s why I&#39;m in favor of mandating vaccines and even making it possible to prosecute parents for not vaccinating their children. You cannot argue that vaccinations are a decision that only affects the individual getting vaccinated. People who aren&#39;t getting vaccinated literally put an entire ecosystem in danger. Plus, it saves tax payers money when we don&#39;t have to spend money on people who get ill because they refuse vaccinations. Why waste money when we don&#39;t have to?\u00a0",

Measles is nowhere near as serious a disease as polio, of course, and most people recover from it without special problems, but there are people at special risk (like young babies) and it does occasionally prove fatal. It&#39;s not chicken pox--it&#39;s not that benign. Again, it&#39;s a question of weighing risk.",

It&#39;s researchers trying to get it right. Sometimes they get it right immediately, sometimes a faulty study gets through--but then it&#39;s tested and retested by other researchers. Some science gets confirmed over and over, some falls by the wayside. Science has a self-correcting mechanism. Anti-vaxxers are too often about relying on fears (&quot;additives,&quot; of &quot;big pharma&quot;) rather than weighing risks.

Plus, risks from vaccinations are very low. No one would release a vaccination if it came with serious risks involved. So this argument is garbage.\u00a0<br><br>Yes, I do understand that, but it&#39;s still a good idea to get a vaccination for it, just as it is a good idea to get a vaccination for the chicken pox, even if you consider it to be such a &quot;minor illness&quot;. Just consider how much production is wasted if everyone is sick for a week or has to tend to someone who is sick for a week because they chose to not get vaccinated. I don&#39;t have exact data with me, but just consider how much you can do in a week if you don&#39;t have to waste it lying in bed ill. I mean, we lose significant production on one day when we switch over from daylight savings time. If you care about the economy, you will choose the immunity option where you can be immune to a disease, yet still be able to be productive.\u00a0<br><br>I wouldn&#39;t call that cognitive bias. I would call that my bullshit-ometer going crazy. That&#39;s like saying if I read something that says &quot;Coffee is green colored&quot;, then I say &quot;that is wrong&quot;, to which you follow up &quot;you&#39;re just ignorant about coffee because you don&#39;t want to believe it&#39;s green&quot;. I&#39;m just calling the argument for what it is, and that is bullshit. Coffee is not green, and vaccines do in fact work effectively.\u00a0",

You see, what the Tv doesn&#39;t tell you is that vaccines do not prevent carrying the vaccine. , if they work, all the do is prevent infection. <br><br>Example. Two kids go to movies and are exposed to measles one is vaccinated one is not. Next day they both go to school and they are both spreading the measles because vaccination does not stop or prevent you from carrying viruses in your nasal passage or throat etc.  <br><br>That was assuming vaccines work as promised and that&#39;s a big gift since sometimes 75% of children coming down with measles have been fully vaccinated. But for this argument let&#39;s assume they work. The vaccinated child will be spreading the disease without showing any symptoms because he will not get the infection.  The other hand the unvaccinated child will show symptoms and eventually be sent home for a couple weeks to eat chicken soup and watch cartoons keep spreading the virus. <br><br>So when I hear people say get vaccinated because you&#39;re putting all of us at risk it&#39;s pure bunk it&#39;s a marketing ploy. <br><br>Also keep in mind heard immunity is a theory based upon viruses court in the wild and it hasn&#39;t even been proven. Take a Siri for natural infections and superimpose it to a vaccinated population is a stretch since we all know the immune response to natural infection and vaccinations are different.  To be quite honest I don&#39;t even think they understand how the immune system works 100%. When you get in a natural infection you are immune for life while vaccine may have you partially immune  from 2 to 5 years if at all.",

However, before you get a vaccination, you are given a sheet of paper that has information about that particular vaccine. You can also ask your doctor about it, so it isn&#39;t like this information is being hidden from us. Arguing that getting your kids vaccinated is a form of child endangerment is absolutely absurd and requires a large degree of intellectual dishonesty. Do you know what is child endangerment? Not getting your kids vaccinated because it puts them at a higher risk of getting diseases. It puts kids around them at risk for those diseases too. Admittedly, I am a bit intolerant of people who are against vaccinations, because it is the most ridiculous position you can hold and it is one that deserves to be ridiculed into extinction.\u00a0",

The only thing that will change their mind is a dead child in their arms.

My buddy nearly died of encephalitis from chicken pox as a college freshman. You can be he&#39;s had his two daughters vaccinated. Chicken pox is not usually not serious in children, but the risks of serious secondary infections are much higher than the risks associate with vaccinations.  Chicken pox can be deadly in very young children and especially in those with other health conditions.  This nonsense about the link between autism an vaccinations hides a very important fact.  Any child with neurological defects absolutely needs to be vaccinated if it is possible.  Non-neuro-typical kids often have a problem with communicating just how sick they are and the kids that die or are severely injured by common childhood illnesses are often the ones that have other physical issues that make them much more vulnerable than healthy kids.",

Before humans started growing watermelons. natural wild watermelons were about the size of grapes. And through thousands of years of cultivation. They&#39;re now 600 times larger than what they were thousands of years ago.<br>Same thing with corn too. The teosinte plant is an ancestor of corn. it is VERY tiny, and large amounts of it was necessary to feed someone. But through cultivation they were genetically modified. To where they grew much larger than the teosinte. And eventually they ended up like the corn we know today.<br>&quot;But what about toxins from pesticides in gmos?&quot; Your body had a natural defense against toxins. Primarily in the liver. When blood flows through the liver. The liver filters out blood toxins, and then sends it down to the intestines where the toxins get pooped out of your body. Now the amount of toxins in plants that have been correctly treated with pesticides are few enough for your body to handle them effectively, and you would have to be allergic to the pesticide to die from it, now granted there are some pesticides that are really harmful to humans. But I&#39;m talking about pesticides whose damage to the human body is minimal.",

You are aware that it&#39;s not pure, elemental\u00a0mercury that&#39;s in vaccines: its an organomercury compound called thiomersal. In layman&#39;s terms that means its an atom of mercury in a carbon and hydrogen based compound. Why is this any different from normal mercury? Allow me to explain. When an element is part of a compound, the chemical and physical properties of that compound are different to the properties of the atoms that make the compound up. This is a universal truth in chemistry and can be demonstrated through a number of examples. Sodium chloride is made up of sodium and chlorine. Both of these are incredibly dangerous in their elemental form: sodium gives out a lot of heat and hydrogen gas which is flammable when it touches water and chlorine is so toxic that in WWI it was used as a weapon by the Germans. However you eat sodium chloride every day as table salt which provided you don&#39;t eat too much of it. Potassium is in the same group of elements as sodium and it literally ignites when it touches water: however bananas and avocadoes are filled with potassium in a non-elemental form. I don&#39;t know about you but I&#39;ve never had an explosion occur in my stomach when I&#39;ve had a banana smoothie or guacamole. (If you have however you may want to either get that checked or switch supermarkets). My point is that just because a compound has mercury as part of its molecular formula, does not mean that it is as poisonous as real mercury.\u00a0 As for thiomersal, there is no evidence whatsoever to suggest its at all harmful to humans at the levels that they are at in vaccinations, it is merely in the vaccine as a preservative and furthermore, it has been absent in the ingredients list of all routine childhood vaccinations for quite some time.

Vaccination works by boosting your immune system via stimulated production of antibodies. The reason you don&#39;t get sick is because when you do have the pathogen exposure, your immune system kills it or at the very least reduces the amount of pathogen in your body. This in turn reduces the likelihood of passing it onto someone else--perhaps someone who hasn&#39;t been vaccinated or whose immune system wasn&#39;t as strongly prepared by vaccination as yours.<br><br>Think of it via this analogy: if I smoke 1 cigarette and you smoke 1000 cigarettes, we&#39;re both smoking--but who&#39;s more likely to cause a passer-by health issues from second-hand smoke?

The first study there, if you look at the source, used data from 1997 to 2002, and was analyzed in 2009...yet it only found any significant impact from before 1999. Strange how half of their range found no association, isn&#39;t it? And why cut off the data at 2002, skipping the next 6 to 7 years of data they could have used? It seems very cherry-picked to me, and is certainly not applicable to modern vaccines, especially when it wasn&#39;t even a controlled study (it was just a correlation analysis).<br><br>2. The second says literally nothing about vaccines, and so is irrelevant. It&#39;s about environmental toxins that aren&#39;t even found in vaccines.<br><br>3. The third only links autism to vaccination in the case where the vaccine causes a rare encephalitic reaction. If you look up the numbers, in a decade from 1990 to 2000, 1396 people in the US had any type of encephalitis within 6 weeks of a vaccination. Now, ignoring the fact that there&#39;s no known mechanism of action and 6 weeks is a long period, thus making this correlation and not causative, even if it <b>were</b> causative, that&#39;s only 140 people per year. In 2000, about 95% of US citizens were vaccinated--and there were 282.2 million people in the US that year. So if we do the math, that means it would only even be <b>possible</b> in 0.000005% of people. That&#39;s a miniscule number of cases (1 in 20 million), and it&#39;s the maximum possible by this process. Even if the results weren&#39;t completely based on correlation rather than determined causation, it would still be so incredibly rare that it would be outweighed by the benefits of vaccination.<br><br>4. Thiomersal hasn&#39;t been in vaccines since at least 2002, so this is another irrelevant study.<br><br>I could go on down the list, but I think I&#39;ve made my point: these aren&#39;t 30 scientific studies that show vaccines cause autism, they&#39;re 30 cherry-picked studies that either are irrelevant to modern vaccinations or show inconsequentially rare potential correlations with no causative link.<br><br>If you&#39;d like me to continue with my analysis of all 30, I can do that Wednesday when I have more time, just let me know; otherwise, I think my point has gathered enough evidence.",

But if you&#39;re NOT allergic, you SHOULD take the vaccine, the benefits FAR outway the risks.Also you seem to be implying that vaccines contain large amounts of formaldehyde. This is wrong, Formaldehyde levels in one dose are INCREDIBLY little, so much that it cannot cause any harm.

Back then, the only thing you could use would be radiation, and radium or plutonium being injected wouldn&#39;t go unnoticed for so long.

Try asking a 5 year-old the difference between a rhomboid and a rectangle (assuming they know both shapes) and they&#39;ll just stare blankly like the sheep in the fields. Ask an adult, though, and unless they&#39;ve entirely missed basic education, they&#39;ll have a valid answer. While the differences you mentioned are small from a technical perspective, they have a huge functional impact. If the brain were almost fully developed by age 5, we wouldn&#39;t have a problem giving out driving licenses for smaller vehicles to the kids tall enough to reach everything. But no, fine motor function sucks all the way into the teen years, abstract thought is absent in kids ages 11 and below, planning and foreseeing is barely starting to develop at age five, no ability to take responsibility seriously...

Thank you. <br>As for why anti-vaccine movement exists: <br>If one doesn&#39;t give their child a vaccine despite there being higher odds of them getting sick and dying, then at least they can say: it was in the hands of nature/god/&quot;some outside, incontrollable factor&quot;.<br>But if one gives their child a vaccine and they happen to get the much less likely outcome of some side-effect, then they would think they directly chose to have their child to get sick. Many parents don&#39;t choose to take on that responsibility and emotional baggage.",

The Black Plague went away because EVERYONE DIED, not because it decided that 50 million people was enough. 60% of Europe died. It\u2019s managed now with antibiotics now. But why is polio gone? Because vaccines introduced a dead version of the virus, or a similar one that didn\u2019t attack humans, and let the human body fight it, and remember it. So that if you caught it, it could fight it immediately, and not get sick, if your kid catches polio, and gets full body paralysis, only you will be to blame. Since &quot;Big Pharma&quot; couldn\u2019t even touch your children to try and keep them safe from your neglect.",

My gawd run for the hills!<br>- 200 thousand deaths from whooping cough each year!? Bullshit - from the CDC &quot;about 200,000 children got sick (not died) with it each year in the United States and about 9,000 died as a result of the infection. Now we see about 10,000 to 40,000 cases reported each year and unfortunately some deaths. From 200k to 40k, not the best outcome now is it.\u00a0<br>- 16 thousand deaths from polio? Again, this is approximately how many people were paralyzed not deaths. Still terrible but tell the truth!<br>-  47 thousand deaths from rubella? Again utter bullshit. The CDC website says 2100 newborns died. 4% of the claims made in this garbage video.<br><br>Compare these all to the 37,000 who die in motor vehicle accidents each year and it kind of puts it into perspective. We banning cars next? Big pharma got a vax for cars in the works? How about the 1 in 59 children now diagnosed with Autism? thats 67,000 per year! A far greater epidemic than any of these diseases above.  Especially when you combine the fact many of the reported deaths in the 40s would not have occurred in this day due to better nutrition and medical care.

You can&#39;t expect to inject kids with a form of Mercury as babies and expect no repercussions. There&#39;s a reason the anti-vax movement is rising against these mandatory vaccinations.

                "text": "People who don&#39;t want their child to get vaccinated are stupid. Vaccines DO NOT cause autism. Autism is a condition you are BORN WITH. You cannot just develop it. Autism affects how you relate to and communicate with other people. So the symptoms start showing when children start socializing with others, which is why it is usually seen when children start nursery/school and have to be around others. The reason more people are being diagnosed then before is simply because science know knows more about it. In the past, anyone who was different (autistic, have mental illness ect.) were locked up in institutions away from society. Children with autism were simply seen as &#39;being naughty&#39;. But now, there has been more and more research done by scientists and doctors, which means we are understanding autism better. As a result this makes the symptoms easier to recognize and diagnose, which is why more people are being diagnosed with it.<br><br>The people who still believe a study from 1998 are ridiculous. The paper was retracted and the doctor who wrote it had his licence taken away. He was proved to be a fraud who made up and faked his findings. Since then, there have been loads of scientific studies that show NO link between vaccines and autism. And yet people still believe it. <br><br>Also, not getting your child vaccinated not only puts them in danger, but also other children. One person can spread the virus to 18 other people, causing them to become infected. There are also some children who are allergic to the vaccine who need others to protect them. If your children dont get the vaccine and catch the virus, there could be serious affects such as brain damage, hearing loss or death. And yet parents still dont want to get their kids vaccinated.<br><br>With the right support, many people with autism go on to lead full independent lives.

Is there currently a mechanism to ensure that the vaccine compounds are openly shared and changes to them monitored by independent SCIENTISTS AND THE SCIENTISTS WHO ORIGINALLY DEVELOPED THEM? Sorry caps lock. I am posting these videos to Facebook to encourage parents to always vaccinate but in some of my more paranoid moments I worry about this. \u00a0In the old days we were so focussed on obvious benefits and the frontier science of it whereas now, past all that, the devils may have found work for their idle hands.",

NCVIA&#39;s purpose was to eliminate the potential financial liability of vaccine manufacturers due to vaccine injury claims[1] to ensure a stable market supply of vaccines, and to provide cost-effective arbitration for vaccine injury claims.[2] Under the NCVIA, the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (NVICP) was created to provide a federal no-fault system for compensating vaccine-related injuries or death by establishing a claim procedure involving the United States Court of Federal Claims and special masters.[1][3]",

Do you think there is any problem in, and with that? It is again all proven with the pharma clinical trials and previously done scientific studies to be entirely safe and effective; and so you would suppose and expect; right? The fact is that NONE of it has been tested for safety, and obviously they have not tested even as much as if or not serious levels of DNA residual fragments contamination exist in those vaccines.

So she waited for a month  after his birthday because she thought that the letter had gotten lost in the post but eventually called the health visitor to see what was going on and the nurse found out for her. And the nurse was really annoyed at whoever had taken his name off that list. He got them done and he was absolutely fine but the fact that someone who works in the medical profession decided that a baby that wasn&#39;t his/her own child wasn&#39;t to get his vaccines on time because younger kids that were probably a couple weeks or at most a month older (and therefore could have waited a couple more weeks to a month more). I know I&#39;ve ranted but it really annoyed me that he never got them on time because of someone else making  a decision like that.",

I miss school maybe 1 day a year and that&#39;s usually due to stomach viruses or other things that you cannot receive a vaccination for. I am very thankful that my parents chose not to vaccinate me along with my 3 other siblings. My personal opinion on this matter is that if \u00a0vaccines are created to prevent you or your child from getting the disease, then why would it be an issue for you. Please stop trying to force others to inject a small dose of the disease into their bodies because doctors claim that it will protect them from giving that disease to others. I mean, the number of effected people are based on how many are exposed to the disease, not on how many refuse to inject it into their bodies.\ufeff",

I think the hesitation and refusal to get vaccinated isn\u2019t simply because we don\u2019t recall the horrors of the diseases.<br><br>Rather it\u2019s the tap dance doctors do to avoid answering certain questions. It\u2019s the sense that no one wants to acknowledge the people who do have severe illness due to vaccines. Let me give a couple examples.<br><br>I believe it was 2012 when members of the military were about to deploy to Middle East. They were required to get the anthrax vaccine and small pox vaccine. Immediately several<br>Soldiers had negative effects. All of which is documented in their military medical records. It took decades for them to finally get diagnosed with disease impacting the heart (it\u2019s often misdiagnosed as severe heartburn). The illnesses they had were on the black box warning, yet the military and VA refuse to recognize these issues as qualifying for VA healthcare. All sides agree on vaccines received. All sides agree immediate medical effects were reported. All sides agree that the illnesses that were finally diagnosed are known side effects. Yet they refuse to provide these soldiers with healthcare.  (Please, don\u2019t take my word for it, research it, it\u2019s not hard to find).<br><br>Another example of questionable trust centers around the measles vaccine (MMR),  Rarely will doctors truly explain possible side effects and failures. No one can explain why some people who are completely vaccinated will still become infected with measles. Or you have those people who were vaccinated in the 60\u2019s. Unbeknownst to patients, the vaccine given back then was found to be ineffective. Yet most people have no clue that they\u2019re walking around with no immunity.<br><br>All in all, there is a serious lack of transparency when it comes to vaccines. Then you have those who are vaccinated but still infected, yet medical community will do everything it can to avoid accepting that responsibility.<br><br>Most people, parents especially, want to protect our kids. But when programs are done in such suspect manner, it\u2019s hard to decide which is the greater evil.<br><br>As for those who choose to not be vaccinated, that\u2019s their choice. That\u2019s also a choice they\u2019ll have to shoulder if/when they or their families become infected. <br><br>Regardless of your view/choice, each person wants to make the right choice. But there is a lot of mistrust floating in the medical community. I think we\u2019d see much better results if the topic of side effects were discussed openly, honestly and allow each person to make the best informed decision they can.",

                "text": "One Vaccine track record does not legitimize another. Each vaccine is its own product. Let me reiterate with an example, just because a pill like Viagra works it does not justify something like opioids. Today we have way more vaccines than we did 50 years ago. Vaccines like MMR and HPV are no where near as safe nor understood as something like the polio vaccine. Also adjuvants are in each vaccine and no one understands the effects of adjuvants building up in people\u2019s tissues over time. Current analysis says adjuvants leave the system within weeks of injection. They came to this conclusion based on blood tests showing decreasing accumulations of adjuvants however they were not able to identify the adjuvants being expelled from the body from urination etc... we have however recently found adjuvant accumulation in organs and brain tissue. If adjuvants such as aluminum accumulate in brain tissue that could be the cause of Alzheimer\u2019s or other neurodevelopmental diseases. Again we cannot confirm this but if virologists are raising this concern so should the people who receive the vaccines. This is not an anti-vaxx comment it is rather a pro vaccine conversation comment. Discussion is the crux of scientific discovery and review.",

Would you go on promoting vaccines?  <br><br>Did you know that that to protect vaccine manufacturers from liability, there was a fund created in 1986 called the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program that provides financial compensation to those affected?<br><br>Giving vaccines to your children is playing the percentages so can you really fault some parents for not wanting to take the chance that their kid draws the short stick?<br><br>A question that I have wondered is for the older generations to answer.

                "text": "Joe, it&#39;s sad to see such a reputable educator give only one side of the story.  Vaccines in principle can work, but at the amount they are given today, 59 doses of 14 vaccines by age 6 has created the sickest generation ever recorded.  Each vaccine contains neurological-toxins which when given at 59x in six years can reek havoc with the human body.  Oh, and do you know, the FDA just lost a lawsuit because they couldn&#39;t produce any safety tests done on vaccines in the last 30 years.  Please watch The Highwire, read through Robert F. Kennedy&#39;s Jr&#39;s non-profit Children&#39;s Health Defense or read through National Vaccine Information Center (NVIC.org) to get updated information on the serious risks of vaccines.   A lot of kids look-up to you to teach them the truth.  Please don&#39;t let yourself become a mouth-piece for the pharmaceutical companies.  Better nutrition, as the opening to this video explained, can go a long way to allowing humans to beat infectious diseases, have life-long immunity and not suffer the side-effects of injected near-toxins.  Thanks for your time and consideration to educating the public on the true risks of vaccines.",

                "text": "I have been a Registered Nurse for 22 years and have kept myself fully up-to-date with all mandatory vaccines. There was never any coercion,  I was almost proud of the fact I was protecting my body against disease and thus protecting my patients.<br><br>Then in 1996 I was offered the flu shot at work by an Occupational Health Nurse. I fell ill the next day and was off sick for approximately 2 weeks. I recall stating it was the worst flu I ever had. I knew my flu-like symptoms were vaccine-induced and I have avoided flu shots ever since. I have spoken to many other Registered Nurses who have had similar experiences and who have subsequently rejected offers of free shots at work.<br><br>This was my first negative experience with getting vaccinated, I won&#39;t say &quot;immunised: as immunity is just implied, it&#39;s not a given. I was 24 years old at the time and I recall telling my mother and advising her against getting the flu shot. I told her that I took the flu shot because my GP deemed me to be in the high risk category, being asthmatic and having lots of patient contact  It was then that she first told me that I was a perfectly healthy baby until I received my shots at 1 year old after which I developed chronic Asthma.<br><br>In 2005 whilst working in a Drug Detox Unit in London I was offered a free Hepatitis B vaccination. It was recommended that all staff be covered as we were treating mainly intravenous drug users many of whom were Hep B positive.<br><br>Within a few hours of receiving the shot I was talking to another nurse who then gave me a perplexed looked and said &quot;your eyes are blinking at different rates&quot;.  I recall feeling light-headed, hot and flushed and going to the toilet to splash some cold water on my face. When I looked in the bathroom mirror I noticed the right side of my face had drooped, my right eye was half closed, my lips were turned down on the right and I could only smile with the left side of my mouth and blink with my left eye. I became quite anxious and feared I was having a stroke and my heart was racing. I called on another nurse who fetched the Doctor who immediately called a blue-light ambulance and I was rushed to ED. By the time I got to hospital I was hyperventilating and panic-stricken.<br><br>The doctor in the Emergency Department examined me and reassured me that I was not having a stroke and my symptoms were more like Bell&#39;s Palsy.  He stated the most likely cause was the Hep B shot. He then referred me to a Neurologist who later also attributed my facial paralysis to the Hep B vaccination. I was fortunate enough for most of the tone to return to my face after about 4 to 6 weeks.<br><br>This experience made me very cautious about vaccines and also very curious about them. I decided to do a little research and cross-reference my findings and attempt to discern the truth about the effectiveness and risks of vaccines.<br><br>I discovered that the risks are significant especially if there is any family history of adverse reactions. This concerned my wife and I  as we were planning on starting a family. I was also rather disturbed about  the incestuous relationship the multi-billion dollar pharmaceutical industry has with the medical profession and our politicians. They have our politicians in their pocket. They are compromised and will not defend our rights against these companies, many of whom fund research and educational institutions.  <br>That&#39;s why we have had our rights stripped from us. That is why we are being coerced, manipulated and yes FORCED into government vaccination programs by the use of fear and punishment through the denial of benefits to any family who refuse to allow the government (in collusion with big pharma) to decide what is injected into our bodies.<br><br>Many people maybe aware that more people die every year from pharmaceutical drugs than all the deaths from all the illegal drugs combined. It&#39;s safer to visit a drug-dealer than a GP! Our politicians have given them blanket immunity from prosecution. You may not have immunity but the pharmaceutical industry has!<br><br>Why has there been such a massive increase in Autistic Spectrum Disorders and all of these Auto-Immune Disorders? Why is our body attacking itself?<br>I think we are tampering with something so complex and intricate and in the process we are destroying our immune systems and creating disease, disorders and death.<br><br>So now I have 2 beautiful, healthy children, 9 and 6 and have been through the agonising decision about whether to vaccinate them or not. I did a lot more reading and  took the informed decision  not to vaccinate either of them. When I asked my GP to sign the Conscientious Objection Form he said &quot;you&#39;re an idiot&quot; in a derogatory and condescending manner. At the time I began to question myself and wondered if I was being too-cautious or even irresponsible but I couldn&#39;t unlearn what I had learned. Now in hindsight I know I did the right thing. My children are healthier than most. My 6 year old daughter has never seen a GP and my son has had one ear infection and the flu.<br><br>So all good as regards my family&#39;s health. But all is not good with our family&#39;s finances.  Like most families we struggle. I am the sole bread winner for my family of 4, my wife is in full-time studies. I am a nurse of 22 years experience and I earned $2198 last pay. I want to give my children the best start in life that we can possibly provide. Since January we have had all our government benefits stopped. I recently paid $2800 in childcare fees over the Christmas school holidays so my wife could work in childcare for $22 an hour. What she earned was paid in fees and unlike most we will not receive any reimbursement from the government for those fees because they have denied us the right to be a conscientious objector. <br><br>There used to be a warning with the vaccines stating it was contraindicated for those with a family history of adverse reactions but this warning was removed to reduce liability and promote compliance.   <br><br>After my experience I could not be persuaded by anyone to put my kids at risk from vaccines after being personally injured by them. I also have a moral objection to vaccines now that I know that aborted human fetal tissue is used in the manufacturing process of some vaccines.<br><br>But none of this matters to the government who have decided to deny my children  thousands of dollars that could be spent on meeting their many needs. The government have and will continue to punish my family financially along with many other families who have a genuine concern about the safety of vaccines and have made the informed decision not to vaccinate.<br><br>I know my story is nothing compared to the story of many others. I can&#39;t imagine the pain of loosing someone or caring for someone with life-long learning difficulties and I feel for others who are struggling financially because of what the Australian government has done.<br><br>I believe SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome) in reality is many times VIDS (Vaccine-Induced Death Syndrome). Many, many parents would also agree with me.  I have a nurse colleague who&#39;s friend received the swine flu shot whilst pregnant. Her unborn child died shortly afterwards, this was in the third trimester. She had a small funeral service for her child which she had to deliver dead.  During the funeral she herself died!<br>her husband blames the vaccines for the death of his wife and child and understandably so.<br><br>My wife is now studying to become a nurse. She started last month and is now required to have mandatory vaccinations, including Hep B which she is fearful of as she witnessed the reaction I had. If she refuses she cannot go on clinical practice to a hospital and will have to leave the course and the end of her dream to become a nurse.<br>In the future I will be expected to comply with Hep B and Tetanus boosters and there is now talk of making flu vaccines mandatory for all healthcare workers. Where will this end if we give up our sovereign rights over our own bodies?<br><br>When a substance is injected directly into the bloodstream it bypasses all of the body&#39;s natural defense systems. A child&#39;s immune system is immature and is repeatedly bombarded with dead and live viruses along with mercury,  formaldehyde etc etc.<br>I have not allowed my children to be injected with these substances and I will continue not to allow it. I just wish my family were not being discriminated against. I wish my rights were respected and protected.  I feel a sense of injustice and wish I could get the right advice on what to do.<br><br>Why are so many people allowing the Australian government to decide on what they are injected with? This isn&#39;t Communist China, it&#39;s not Nazi Germany. If people don&#39;t defend their rights they&#39;ll loose them. I hope these draconian Hitler-style punitive government tactics completely backfire and promotes activists who are willing to defend the right to govern their own bodies.<br><br>As regards this video, I thought it was quite simply weak propaganda but unfortunately  many people will be fooled by it. To even start this video by stating &quot;there is no debate&quot; about vaccines is absolutely ludicrous and simply plain stupid. This video was made BECAUSE there is a debate and because people are starting to realise that vaccines are not only dangerous but they can be lethal.<br>Ask yourself 2 questions<br>Do you trust politicians?  YES or NO<br>Do you trust the billion dollar pharmaceutical companies?  YES or NO<br><br>It&#39;s a no-brainer!<br><br>Thanks for reading.<br>Regards<br>A concerned nurse",

So why are babies required to get a litany of vaccines before they develop their own immune systems?<br><br>2. From a business standpoint, suppose you have total immunity from any prosecution, civil and criminal, that might happen as a result of harm done by your product.

Giving a human baby 21 or more diseases thru vaccination in the first year alone is enough to produce the confused immune systems we now have, with rampant allergies, and again, a confused immune system that no longer recognizes invaders to the body (like cancers) and doesn&#39;t react properly.\u00a0I won&#39;t even go\u00a0 into the autism battle.\u00a0 Those big pharma have enough money and corrupt friends in high places to deny any truths\u00a0about their poisons.\u00a0 Bottom line, sanitation is the number-one reason for our prevention of disease.

Look it up.\u00a0 All these infections began to disappear when we stopped living in feces, etc.\u00a0 Unfortunately, vaccines came about around this era, and then claimed to be the reason for the decline.\u00a0 If we had go back to no sanitation,\u00a0such as after a disaster, \u00a0all your vaccines will be proved to have little to no effect.\u00a0 These so-called childhood diseases PRIME the body to fight real disease later ion life.\u00a0 This system is weakening the immune system of our kids. Explain to me why we would want to weaken the immune systems of our children?\u00a0 No more lies please, were SICK of it. Besides, your vaccinated child, with its &#39;live&#39; or &#39;attenuated&#39; virus, is a walking carrier of a spreadable disease for the unvaccinated for several days after the shot.\u00a0 Your system of vaccination is what spreads the diseases\u00a0 now.\u00a0 Debunk me all you want... I&#39;m not a Doctor so I&#39;m not allowed to talk about it, right? Lastly, how is my unvaccinated child a threat to your vaccinated child?\u00a0 I thought you said that vaccines work?",

                "text": "Here is some info on Bill Gates and his horrific, amazing cash cow, vaccine:\r<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVYWKyslti4  This doctor produced vid tells what I think the scare tactics are really moving the unsuspecting and too trusting  populace toward.\r<br>\r<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY-vLrz9XCc\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY-vLrz9XCc</a>  I personally  think that when Gates talks here about &quot;the final solution&quot; through his vaccine program, that he is deliberately (probably gleefully) revealing what he is really up to.  He counts on the naive and trusting to not think it was just some strange slip of the tongue.  \r<br>\r<br>The phrase &quot;the final solution&quot; was, of course, made famous through Nazis in regard to their eugenicist plan for exterminating Jews.  They also made &quot;essential services&quot; famous.  Of course the &quot;need&quot;for &quot;essential services&quot; was used to cull and control the populace.\r<br>\r<br> Gates and others working with him want to put invisible tattoos on children and others to track their &quot;health&quot; and vaccination records.  Now what are those tattoos reminescent of from last century?\r<br>\r<br>He is so interested in decreasing population, particularly in the vulnerable African countries.  Uh, who asked him to be a depopulation czar for our planet?  No one.  Why don&#39;t Bill and Melinda start depopulating with themselves?  Oh, wait.  We are supposed to assume that they are god like beings who get to make decisions for human &quot;population control&quot; in the world, while they are are above such consideration.  Another underlying assumption appears to be that people in Africa, especially, need to be stopped from reproducing more black people.\r<br>\r<br>The need to depopulate is a eugenicist myth.  If all the people in the world were to stand together in one place, they would fit into a large city easily.  All one has to do is fly over this country and other countries, including even little but highly productive Israel, and see the vast amount of empty, unpopulted, space that is out there.  \r<br>\r<br>Let&#39;s see.  Gates has a strong family background promoting eugenics.  He called his vaccine &quot;the final solution.&quot;  He wants to depopulate the world.  AND he wants you, with force if possible, to take his vaccine.  See any red flags there?\r<br>\r<br>This less than one minute vid, with the smirks on Bill&#39;s &amp; Melinda&#39;s faces, is incredibly creepy:    <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmP6_gy-MIE\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmP6_gy-MIE</a>  I&#39;ll quote a You Tuber here about this vid. &quot;The fact he smirks and claims the second one will get attention means this is orchestrated.&quot; \r<br>\r<br>Here is a video with Senator Robert Kennedy Jr. vs Alan Deshowtiz.  Kennedy gives tons of hard core data about how harmful vaccines are.  Derschowitz gives the dracononian party line.\r<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfnJi7yLKgE\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfnJi7yLKgE\r</a><br>\r<br>See the movie Vaxxed on You Tube.  It has hard core documentation showing the corruption in Big Pharma in regard to vaccines.",

Thus, parents who vaccinate their children can indeed put others at risk,\u201d explains Leslie Manookian, documentary filmmaker and activist. Manookian\u2019s award winning documentary, The Greater Good, aims to open a dialog about vaccine safety.<br><br>Both unvaccinated and vaccinated individuals are at risk from exposure to those recently vaccinated. Vaccine failure is widespread; vaccine-induced immunity is not permanent and recent outbreaks of diseases such as whooping cough, mumps and measles have occurred in fully vaccinated populations.14,15\u00a0Flu vaccine recipients become more susceptible to future infection after repeated vaccination.16, 17<br><br>\u201cHealth officials should require a two-week quarantine of all children and adults who receive vaccinations,\u201d says Sally Fallon Morell, president of the Weston A. Price Foundation. \u201cThis is the minimum amount of time required to prevent transmission of infectious diseases to the rest of the population, including individuals who have been previously vaccinated.\u201d<br><br>\u201cVaccine failure and failure to acknowledge that live virus vaccines can spread disease have resulted in an increase in outbreaks of infectious disease in both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals,\u201d says Manookian, \u201cCDC should instruct physicians who administer vaccinations to inform their patients about the risks posed to others by those who\u2019ve been recently vaccinated.\u201d<br><br>According to the Weston A. Price Foundation, the best protection against infectious disease is a healthy immune system, supported by adequate vitamin A and vitamin C. Well-nourished children easily recover from infectious disease and rarely suffer complications.<br><br>The number of measles deaths declined from 7575 in 1920 (10,000 per year in many years in the 1910s) to an average of 432 each year from 1958-1962.18\u00a0The vaccine was introduced in 1963. Between 2005 and 2014, there have been no deaths from measles in the U.S. and 108 deaths from the MMR vaccine.19<br><br>The Weston A.

We do not know the status of the others. According to CDC there are about 100 measles cases this year, 67 of which are related to Disneyland. While CDC says most of the 67 Disneyland cases were unvaccinated or vaccination status is unknown, they assume that if this outbreak is similar to last year, about 20% were vaccinated. It is clear from the experience at Disneyland and the scientific literature that both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals can contract and spread disease and the demonization of the unvaccinated is unfair, inappropriate and borders on fear mongering.\u00a0<br><br>2) See also, an added footnote # 17 in the fifth paragraph. The rest of the footnotes are renumbered, accordingly.",

                "text": "Here&#39;s the way it works. Some people just find it too uncomfortable to contemplate the idea that vaccination (and healthcare in general) might be surrounded by a lot of mythology , money and distorted science. We don&#39;t like to think that it&#39;s possible that pharmaceutical companies might be  aggressively &quot;selling&quot; things to us that are not  good for us or could harm us. All in the name of big money. That&#39;s just too disturbing. <br><br>However , there are plenty of examples from history of companies , scientists and governments telling us that something is perfectly safe and effective and  then we later found out that it wasn&#39;t. I totally understand why some people will resist this idea like their lives depended on it because it&#39;s too shocking to think  that babies are being injected with vaccines that could cause them brain damage whilst at the same time governments and pharmaceuticals are  neglecting  safety concerns. All in the name of money. That&#39;s not going to help you sleep at night. <br><br>The real question is - how naive do you want to be?  Vaccine skeptics (or &quot;anti vaxxers&quot;) are portrayed as ignorant wacky conspiracy theorists who are into pseudoscience. The irony is that it is often the pro vaxxers that are far less informed about the real science behind the mainstream mythology.  <br><br>I get it.  It is totally weird to think that maybe everything you thought you knew about vaccines  might not be as true as you think it is and the actual science is the other way round. But this is exactly what vaccine skeptics believe. We believe you are not being told the truth. They think you are too gullible and trusting to think for yourself and that you will not  question what you are told. They hope that you will not want your view of the world turned upside down.  They don&#39;t want you to do your own thinking or your own research because when you do you come across many  things like this.......<br><br>Aluminium and autism (aluminium is in some vaccines) <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0946672X17308763\">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0946672X17308763</a><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8dJxpiPbsY\">https://youtu.be/B8dJxpiPbsY</a><br><br>What the HepB vaccine does to mice<br><a href=\"http://vaccinesafetycommission.com/pdfs/Neonatal-hepatitis-B-vaccination-impaired-the-behavior-and-neurogenesis-of-mice-transiently-in-early-adulthood..pdf\">http://vaccinesafetycommission.com/pdfs/Neonatal-hepatitis-B-vaccination-impaired-the-behavior-and-neurogenesis-of-mice-transiently-in-early-adulthood..pdf</a> <br><br><br>ACIP voices<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyfeC1EawXQ\">https://youtu.be/XyfeC1EawXQ</a><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VM9qtNzVUOg\">https://youtu.be/VM9qtNzVUOg</a><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of4v44Q13TA\">https://youtu.be/of4v44Q13TA</a><br><br>How the system can suppress safety concerns....<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rdKM9LEdVQ\">https://youtu.be/_rdKM9LEdVQ</a> <br><br>\u201c.......from Egypt forward they\u2019ve been running around believing they had a perfect grip on things and yet we look back at every society that preceded us with great smugness at how naive they all were.

Polio is now called NPAFP, Non Polio Acute Flaccid Paralysis.  Before 1956 Polio was caused by DDT pesticide chlorine poisoning.  DDT got banned.   <br> In the video it states that there are &quot;1 in a million serious side effects caused by vaccines&quot;, fake number!  The links under the video, &quot;How risky are vaccine side effects?&quot; point to the CDC.   The CDC site does not give numbers in most vaccine injury stats, it simply says &quot;As with any medicine, there is a very remote chance of a vaccine causing a serious injury or death&quot; , there are no numbers where you see this statement.  The 1 in a million number appears on the CDC page refering to allergic reactions being this rare. But it does not say how common are other reactions. The vaccine inserts all describe serious complications, the CDC could have put that information up and specific numbers next to each reaction.",

Just wanted to share a quote from Gayle Delong of the Department of Economics and Finance at Baruch College, New York:<br><br>&quot;For years, vaccine consumer groups have been asking for studies comparing long term health outcomes of vaccinated and unvaccinated children, but public health bodies have refused to sponsor them. In 2004, a Dutch association for conscientious vaccination conducted a nation-wide survey of 635 children. During the first five years of life, compared to the unvaccinated children, the vaccinated ones had suffered at least twice as many incidents of antibiotic use, rheumatic complaints, loss of consciousness, convulsions/collapse, aggressive behaviour (a huge difference!), inflammation of the throat (also huge), ear infection, febrile convulsions and crying spells lasting more than three hours.&quot;<br><br>Vaccinens may protect against one illness, but may invite a host of others.<br><br>I hope this channel keeps on top of this subject. It&#39;s a very important one.",

By the time the Salk polio vaccine was released, April 12, 1955, the incidence of polio had already declined to about 10 cases per 100,000. Polio was already in its way out. You can look at the graph released in 1972 on the CDC&#39;s website. High levels of antibodies (titers) to the vaccine antigen doesn&#39;t give you immunity. Titers wane over time and that&#39;s why MDs push &quot;booster shots.&quot; Wild caught virus gives you real immunity. The measles vaccine was introduced in 1963 when measles was almost out as well. I encourage people to do their own research and stop trusting what MDs say. Look at vaccines&#39; package inserts, components, and side effects (post-marketing experience). Vaccine side effects are real.",

It is twisted genius in action, making intelligent, independent-thinking people ignore their honest, well-founded vaccine skepticism, and causing the rest to accept unlimited vaccinations without question.<br><br>\u00a0There are two primary reasons why vaccinating oneself cannot protect others, and why failing to vaccinate cannot endanger others. The first is from the science of immunology, and we can describe it as waning antibody stimulation, post-vaccination. In short, vaccines only do one thing-stimulate antibody production to something similar but not the same as the infection. That antibody stimulation is temporary, lasting only a few months or years. So the majority of the US population has had no so-called vaccine &quot;protection&quot; for several decades, without any resurgent epidemics of measles, mumps, pertussis, etc.<br><br>The second is from the science of population outcomes, or epidemiology. In all populations globally who have ever attained the ever-rising and completely arbitrary (made up) minimum threshold for vaccine uptake (% of a population who get vaccinated), outbreaks of vaccinated diseases still occur. This should, of course, be impossible, if herd immunity were actually true.",

Also, Harvard already showed that antibodies doesn&#39;t always = protection.  It&#39;s more complicated then that... <b>eye-roll</b>  You know, something so great wouldn&#39;t have such conflict.  There&#39;s a reason so many doctors and parents are against vaccines, because toxic adjuvants are being injected straight into the blood stream.  Anti-vaccine people aren&#39;t against the concept, their against the toxic adjuvants.  Why is autism, ADHD, allergies, etc. increasing dramatically? Because autistic kids are mating with one another???  Doubtful.  Ingested aluminum IS NOT THE SAME as INJECTED. You can swallow some potassium pills and it&#39;s fine, but inject the same dose and your heart stops.  Educate yourselves people.  And by educate I mean read from sources that aren&#39;t influence by pharmaceutical money (which is hard to come by now days).  And I challenge someone to find me a TRUE placebo controlled study evaluating the safety of vaccinations.  Good luck.",

He told us that the batch they where given had failed and that Health Canada knew of this but refused to inform the public. Vaccination is only 90% effective and not a guarantee of immunity.

Pro vac say 1 in a million adverse reactions but reporting is known to be low. How many are saved? The pro vac folk say potentially millions if an epidemic struck. Would we get an epidemic if we ate better foods, exercised more and had good sanitation? Anti vac folk ignore the possibility of epidemic and the media continues to produce its meaningless headlines and sound bites.<br><br>Anti vac folk say studies are tainted by funding from the manufacturers and the FDA and CDC are in their pockets. Studies and researchers say more study is needed and that bias, conflicts of interest and prejudice against scientists questioning the official line are problems but the FDA fast tracks new vaccines into service while the manufacturers stop studies and start raking in profits. <br>Mercury is terrible (according to anti vac folk) but since it&#39;s been removed or seriously reduced in vaccines (in the US) since 2001 there should be a noticeable decline in Autism numbers but I don&#39;t see that in the stats.<br>Vaccines are the safer alternative (according to the vac fans) but the US government has outlawed taking the manufacturers to court to settle damage claims. If they&#39;re that safe, why do this? Every other manufacturer is liable for damages, why not vaccines? Seat belts, airbags and kiddie seats in cars save lives but build a faulty one and I&#39;ll see you in court. Vaccines, Immune from prosecution.<br><br>Instead of going out of their way to make a pro vaccine or anti vaccine video, can someone with the resources and know how please produce one that tells me the damn truth as we know it today? <br>Countless videos, hours of research on the net and reading many scientific papers and all I know about vaccines is this.<br>PREJUDICE, CONFIRMATION BIAS, PROFITS, POLITICS AND EMOTION ARE STOPPING US FINDING THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAYS TO REDUCE OR PREVENT THE MAJOR HEALTH RAMIFICATIONS OF SERIOUS DISEASE.<br>Science is the answer and science isn&#39;t served well currently by this or any other video I&#39;ve seen on the topic to date.<br><br>Ive never put so many hours into researching anything else with such poor results. To anyone who read this far, I&#39;m sorry I couldn&#39;t make this post funny or more thought provoking and I&#39;m sorry there is this stupid polarised debate. I hope your research fares better.",

                "text": "Being a science nut I understand vaccines and there importance.. however I get the worry. introducing a foreign body into an infant is dangerous anyway you look at it. Even mothers milk can be rejected because of lactose. Infants are fragile common cold or stomach flu can kill them due to fever or lack of fluids. Asking any parent to subject there child to multiple shots of any substance that is complicated to understand and has even minuscule chance at adverse reaction is difficult pill for a parent to swallow. There instincts want to resist at every level. The biggest problem I see is no negotiation or education in a calm and self assuring nature.  The reaction is either just do it. or do you want your baby to die, or do you wanna make other people sick? Or I&#39;m the doctor but what do I know. (harsh sarcasm) I honestly think if any medical practice person addressed me or my loved in such a way they might end up with a fat lip or black eye. To allow someone to inject a substance you don&#39;t understand into your month old baby is a very very serious matter on both sides of the fence.  I honestly get mad at the people on here chastising the Anti Vacciers. It&#39;s like they lose there sense of humanity. Anti Vacciers are just people. If you wish to sway there decision perhaps approach them with understanding of there worries and work out a solution. I honestly think that many shots at once is very inappropriate. I think they need more spaced out and observation between each dose, but the medical/insurance industrial complex is worried that it would cost more. It&#39;s why they have cont. shortened the stay of mothers after birth. COST. The odds of complications are slim enough they are acceptable to turn it into a 24 hr. stay. Where before they often wanted longer as to make sure mother and child were doing well. I hate that a lot of medicine has turned into how much it&#39;s worth.",

Polio is still around just been renamed a few times. By the way to those who make it seem like polio was such a devastating dissease, its paralysis was 3% to 5% at its heighest and mortality 1%. Out of these the majority were infants due to a weak immune system . Aggressive vaccination is simply a purge of a disease.  We give it to everyone and those who are strong survive; that is pretty much the mentality behind it. Problem with antibodies generated by vaccinatio is that they are much weaker than the full blown disease and thus when exposed to it your vaccine hurts you due to the fact that your body will underestimate the virus.

If anti-vaccine keeps going, it could mean an increase in some of the most life threatening diseases and viruses the human body can get, meaning I am more and more likely every time I go out to pass by an anti-vaccer who just caught something, passed it to me, and potentially ends up taking my life! I just wish anti-vaccers would think more about the others they are hurting, I hope they just keep it in their minds that every small child, baby, or already sick person they pass could mean death to those people because of their idiotic choice. Its not just about you! Vaccines don&#39;t cause autism, its NEVER been proven and endless research has been done debunking it, yet people still use it as an excuse, I&#39;m sorry, when peoples lives are at stake, ignorance is NEVER an excuse to do the WRONG thing. I have an actual medical reason I am not able to get some vaccines, yet I still get the ones I can get safly to protect the ones I love. If I go out and get Measles from an anti-vaccer, before I die from it I will raise soooo much hell, and when I do die from it, which I will, I will haunt the <b>**</b> outa you!",

Vaccines in their current state are not safe or effective. The toxins and adjuvents do not promote health and well-being.There is NO safe amount of mercury inside the body! And that is just one toxin ingredient Vaccines are made for alternative agendas not known to the general public. They alter DNA, infect with piggy-backed virus&#39; (like the SV-40 cancer, and others), laced with chemicals that effect fertility, and others. (no one really knows what is in a vaccine). They are made by companies that are immune from litigation and are not subject to liability or safety, and now our rights to REFUSE vaccines are being stripped away. SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH THIS PICTURE! The CDC, FDA, AMA, etc are all private corporations on Dun &amp; Bradstreet who&#39;s fiscal health depends on BIG PHARMA. Do your research people. Wake up.

When a government can force medication into the bodies of We The People and our most vulnerable children without our consent, what makes them any less guilty than those put to death by the Nuremberg trials for medical experimentation against the consent or will of their participants, or crimes committed against humanity? We will discuss this in much more detail as this article progresses.<br><br>If you think the above a harsh statement, lets look at the facts.<br>Vaccines are scientifically proven to have side-effects ranging from mild to catastrophic. These may include anything from a mild rash, a compromised immune system, sterility, cognitive dysfunction (brain damage), paralysis, cancer, to \u2026 death and many more \u201cproven\u201d issues not mentioned here.<br><br>We are constantly being told by the healthcare personnel we trust that the chance of vaccine damage is \u201cLess than one in a million\u201d, yet statistics prove over and over again that this is a totally erroneous and massively understated number, with the actual occurrences of harm caused by vaccines being massively higher, and much more common.<br><br>Even with the cases reported being well in excess of the laughable quote stated above, we must also consider that the CDC itself states that as few as 1 \u2013 10% of vaccine damage incidents are ever reported as such, making the possible total \u2018Magnitudes Higher\u2019 than what we are made aware of via the CDC or the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). National Vaccine Information Center (NVIC) is stating Proposed Changes Restrict Vaccine Reaction Reporting, making these incidences of vaccine damage even more difficult to track or tally (intentionally).<br><br>Now lets consider that the vaccine court (VICP) in this country has already paid out well over $3 BILLION in damages, and this is to only a very small percentage of possible claimants who actually get their cases heard, and can prove damage to a (known) biased system of supposed justice.<br><br>So how rare can vaccine damage actually be \u2026 ???<br>Approximately thirty thousand (30,000) VAERS reports are filed annually, and again the CDC states that only 10% (on the high side) of actual cases are ever reported \u2026 Yea do the math (300,000)! Now not all of these are life threatening, but how many are life wrecking? If even 10-20% are life threatening, wrecking, or stealing (30,000 \u2013 60,000 a year), that is still a huge number, and magnitudes above \u201cone in a million\u201d (320 nation wide with EVERYONE vaccinated)!<br><br>Now take the above numbers and plot (add) probable vaccine damage over just the last decade \u2026 300,000 x 10 = 3,000,000 and if we use 1% reported \u2026 30,000,000!<br><br>We can easily see, with even the most rudimentary research, the possible incidence of vaccine damage is mind bending and so far above the lies and platitudes fed to us by those we are conditioned to trust that it is almost inconceivable. Please understand that if the above statement (less than one in a million) were true \u2026 Vaccines would be among the safest mechanisms on this planet, but all data points Blatantly to Exactly the Opposite.<br><br>When all is said and done We The People (more every day) are becoming painfully aware of the frequency and magnitude of Vaccine damage and we are horrified and angry!<br><br>How is this Medical Experimentation?<br>With the many proven side-effects, and NO long term Proven Efficacy or Harm Study on vaccines (and multiple dose vaccinations) ever accomplished or commissioned by the CDC, that we are made aware of in a century of use in the USA (try to find one), they can have no scientific or factual claim to being an effective or safe mechanism. Thus by default, HOW can this be considered or categorized as anything more than Medical Experimentation?<br><br>How soon we forget!<br>The Nuremberg trials where 23 defendants, all medical doctors, were accused of having been involved in the horrors of Nazi human experimentation, procedures and exposures without the consent of those experimented on. The trial lasted eight months, from December 9, 1946, to August 20, 1947. Of the 23 defendants, five were acquitted, seven received death sentences, and the remaining received prison sentences ranging from 10 years to life imprisonment. Those sentenced to death were hanged on June 2, 1948, in Landsberg Prison, Bavaria.<br><br>What resulted was the ten points of the Nuremberg Code. Of these ten points several are most germane to this discussion, those being:<br><br>Nuremberg Code: Point #1<br>The voluntary consent of the human subject is absolutely essential. This means that the person involved should have legal capacity to give consent; should be so situated as to be able to exercise free power of choice, without the intervention of any element of force, fraud, deceit, duress, over-reaching, or other ulterior form of constraint or coercion; and should have sufficient knowledge and comprehension of the elements of the subject matter involved as to enable him/her to make an understanding and enlightened decision. This latter element requires that before the acceptance of an affirmative decision by the experimental subject there should be made known to him the nature, duration, and purpose of the experiment; the method and means by which it is to be conducted; all inconveniences and hazards reasonable to be expected; and the effects upon his health or person which may possibly come from his participation in the experiment. The duty and responsibility for ascertaining the quality of the consent rests upon each individual who initiates, directs or engages in the experiment.

Why? It makes more money to &quot;maintain&quot; the disease!<br><br>My problem isn&#39;t about vaccines, for at their core, they are a really smart way of dealing with diseases and helping the body&#39;s natural immunity/resistance to them. \u00a0My problem is that I don&#39;t trust the sick fucks making and selling the vaccines. \u00a0We&#39;re talking serious, high grade, rich beyond measure, sick ass humans here! \u00a0They don&#39;t lust for money anymore, only power and control. \u00a0The world control paradigm trickles back to just a few very powerful families. \u00a0These people fear loss of control, so if they wanted to ensure it, they must make sure the masses are DEPENDENT on their &#39;system&#39;. \u00a0And the sick shit they do to ensure that would make you wonder if they are even human to begin with! \u00a0<br><br>These are the people creating these vaccines to be injected at insane rates to your newborn and toddlers! \u00a0Do you really trust them? \u00a0My guess is for many of you, the answer is hell yes. \u00a0Because if you didn&#39;t trust your masters, your world view crumbles and from unconcious living, you don&#39;t know how to handle that. \u00a0You fight to support your matrix, because without it, you are nothing, you are lost, everything you believe is over and you have no identity.<br><br>Then there are those with the courage to think for themselves, and question EVERYTHING they&#39;ve been trained to believe their entire life. \u00a0Some question such things, and come to the same conclusion they had before, thats fine, thats good. \u00a0But questioning is what you all could be doing! \u00a0Blind faith in those that run our world has never been earned, but... if you just close your eyes, maybe you can just live in their box without realizing you are in their box, and therefore live a normal semi-happy life in ignorance... they do call it bliss yes?<br><br>Look show me a manufacturer of Vaccines that is not owned by the enslaving elitists whose intentions I do not trust, and a full disclosure with multiple third party validation of all ingredients, and you&#39;ll have my vote again for vaccines.<br><br>But as it is, I have a buddy, who at 19, healthy, full of life, went from registering for college (thus must get vaccinated) to quadriplegic INSTANTLY after getting vaccinated. \u00a0This is not due to the inert virus that helps train our immune system, its due to the mystery ingredients that has been pointed out numerous times by people trying to test what exactly is in these cocktails they call medicine. \u00a0DOCTORS don&#39;t even know - they just do their pharmaceutical masters bidding.<br><br>Is permanent paralyzation a rare side effect of vaccines? \u00a0Sure, seems the percentages aren&#39;t that high - but as a parent, what do you choose? \u00a0CHOOSE to inject a substance that very well may paralyze your children for the rest of their lives - or take a risk and hope that your children will not get inflicted with some of these diseases or at least have the strength to combat them successfully if by chance they got something.<br><br>Shitty choices. \u00a0Personally I&#39;d prefer clean vaccines. \u00a0<br><br>SO TO BE CLEAR - I think many parents are lacking trust in the &quot;institution&quot; - not disbelieving the benefit of a nice clean vaccine.",

I don&#39;t know how critical the situation was in the rest of the world, but in Sweden it seemed like media just hyped the whole thing, when in reality there were only a handful of people affected. This scared a lot of people, and triggered them to take the hastily produced vaccine, consequently procuring narcolepsy in way more people than was threatened by the flu. I guess this may have stopped the virus from spreading further. I was only going to criticize the immense profit that can be made of epidemics, and that in many cases the drug industry seems to be just that, an industry, established to make money off of peoples health. I have nothing against vaccines and medicines that has been tested and known to work. I just realized that I am saying nothing in this comment with oh so many words...\u00a0",

Our information is solid and comes from professionals in the field of medicine. If you had the slightest clue what your talking about then you would know you can still spread the virus EVEN if your vaccinated! Educate yourself people. The &quot;debunking&quot; of the link between autism and vaccines has itself been DEBUNKED! Research CDC Whistleblower PhD William W. Thompson, CDC&#39;s own researcher admitted they covered up the link between autism and MMR vaccine! Further these diseases were already declining BEFORE vaccines were even introduced!!! It&#39;s a fact. If vaccines are the only way to eradicate a disease how then do you explain diseases that no longer exist with no vaccine ever made for it? Was there a vaccine for the bubonic plague? No? It should be around then and killed us all by now, that&#39;s only one example! There is a lot you can learn by doing research but keep getting your facts from the news on tv lol. You are the very thing your against, you are walking around UNvaccinated, you believe it&#39;s life long immunity but sorry to disappoint you it&#39;s not, only if you get the disease naturally then you are. (Don&#39;t believe it? Go do some REAL research or get tested, you&#39;ll see) Youtube Dr Tenpenny, Dr Russell Blaylock, Dr Lawrence Palevsky &amp; Dr Mercola (just to name a few) or remain an ignorant fearmonger",

If the only need to have a vaccine is the weakened form of the disease and some solution to be able to inject it into the body, then why is it so difficult to make vaccines? And why does vaccines contain a lot of different chemicals like: Aluminum and Formaldehyde? Cuz that doesn&#39;t seem to be good for the body. I would be very happy if someone could explain, cuz I&#39;m feeling a bit confused. But other than that, the idea of injecting a weakened form of a disease to prevent disease seems good.",
