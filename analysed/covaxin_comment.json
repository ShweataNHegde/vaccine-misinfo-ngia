Petrol price is increased because we have to pay 1.3lakhs cr + 7000cr tax to other countries through which congress purchased oil bonds. Due to pandemic our gdp lost 23% which is a huge no. So to balance it again govt. has to increase price.\n2. After gst which is surely a tax no one has said that price will be reduced.\n3. All your truth are just coming in 2020 year which every country faced problems and it was a tough time for all of us. \n4. If you want security. India has the best defence among all countries after russia, america, japan and china.\n5. For women they are getting every opportunity to stand equal to men. They are allowed to take part in army too. For the women protection to stop rape cases govt. Banned all porn websites from india. But that cannot stop men.\n6. If you compare after 2000 to 2014 gdp fell from 7% to 5% and after bjp it again rose to 8% only of this pandemic would not happen we have been reached 10%. \n7. If you talk about gas prices. So as the demand of things will increase the value will increase. And then too govt. Is giving subsidy to those who can't afford it.\n8. Now if you compare when congress was there they took 6 years to pass a bill to ban acid when a no.  of acid attacks took place. Still bjp is far better than any other politics group in india. No one is better. And to govern a country with a huge population is not easy."
