Not a single drug came from this place  and all the tall claims turn out to be hoaxes. 2DG hype, hype with Ivermectin, hype with all nonsense Ayurveda Pratanjali, and hype with vaccines. Hype with COVID testing kits, stolen ideas of PCR, Big hype of a copycat item (copycat of SherlockTM in the USA), PCR kits from a top engineering college  ( that never saw the light of the day). Quick PCR from Abbott! The list is endless. What was done efficiently was mining credits from all this nonsense. Today, if anyone asks what happened to all the money spent on the research, these jokers will say, look I made my resume glorious who cares for the treatment. One such joker even left the principal institution and ran away somewhere else after earning all credits from taxpayers&#39; money",
